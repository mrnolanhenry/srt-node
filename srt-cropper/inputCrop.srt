1
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,909
Indians!

2
00:01:48,824 --> 00:01:50,033
The cave!

3
00:02:25,194 --> 00:02:26,486
Charge!

4
00:02:30,658 --> 00:02:31,699
Shit! The cavalry!

5
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:25,169
Damn, I ripped
the fuel line.

6
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:14,093
Maggie! Fetch some water!
We got a hurt man here.

7
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:24,729
Mom! Mom, is that you?

8
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:25,980
There, there now.

9
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:29,400
You've been asleep for
nearly six hours now.

10
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:31,778
I had this
horrible nightmare.

11
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:36,824
I dreamed... I dreamed
I was in a Western.

12
00:04:38,494 --> 00:04:44,874
I was being chased by all
these Indians and a bear.

13
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,417
Well, you're safe
and sound

14
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:48,252
here now
at the McFly farm.

15
00:04:49,171 --> 00:04:50,838
McFly farm?

16
00:04:54,051 --> 00:04:57,553
Well, you're my...
You're my, my...

17
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:00,431
Who are you?

18
00:05:00,516 --> 00:05:03,142
The name is McFly.
Maggie McFly.

19
00:05:03,227 --> 00:05:06,771
McFly. Maggie?

20
00:05:07,147 --> 00:05:10,316
And that's Mrs. McFly, and
don't you be forgetting the Mrs.

21
00:05:10,401 --> 00:05:11,693
And what might
your name be, sir?

22
00:05:11,777 --> 00:05:13,611
Well, it's...

23
00:05:17,157 --> 00:05:18,491
Eastwood.

24
00:05:20,285 --> 00:05:22,453
Clint Eastwood.

25
00:05:22,913 --> 00:05:24,706
Well, you hit your head,
Mr. Eastwood.

26
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,416
Not too serious,
but lucky for you,

27
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,543
Seamus found you
when he did.

28
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:30,378
Seamus.

29
00:05:30,462 --> 00:05:31,921
Me husband.

30
00:05:33,632 --> 00:05:37,802
You'll be excusing me, Mr.
Eastwood, while I tend to William.

31
00:05:37,886 --> 00:05:38,886
William.

32
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,764
Oh, that's okay, Will.
It's okay.

33
00:05:48,856 --> 00:05:50,857
That's William?
Aye.

34
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:54,527
William Sean McFly, the first of
our family to be born in America.

35
00:05:55,487 --> 00:05:56,863
It's okay, Will.

36
00:05:56,947 --> 00:06:00,533
This here is Mr. Clint
Eastwood here visiting.

37
00:06:00,617 --> 00:06:02,660
He surely likes you,
Mr. Eastwood.

38
00:06:03,662 --> 00:06:04,954
Maggie.

39
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:08,416
I've got supper.

40
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,127
I'm not one to pry into
a man's personal affairs,

41
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:15,631
but exactly how is it that
you came to be way out here

42
00:06:15,716 --> 00:06:20,052
without a horse,
or boots, or a hat?

43
00:06:20,137 --> 00:06:22,346
Well, my car...

44
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:25,558
Horse broke down,
and a bear ate my boots,

45
00:06:25,642 --> 00:06:27,518
and I guess
I just forgot my hat.

46
00:06:27,603 --> 00:06:30,396
How could you forget
a thing like your hat?

47
00:06:30,481 --> 00:06:31,689
Would you like
some water?

48
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:32,940
Yeah.

49
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:46,120
I'll tell you what
I'll do, Mr. Eastwood.

50
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,539
I'll help you find
your blacksmith friend.

51
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,960
You can stay
the night in the barn,

52
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:56,214
and tomorrow I'll take you
as far as the railroad tracks.

53
00:06:56,298 --> 00:06:58,591
You can follow them
straight on into town.

54
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:03,262
I'll even
give you a hat.

55
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,975
That's great. Thanks.

56
00:07:11,396 --> 00:07:12,939
Ah...

57
00:07:13,023 --> 00:07:14,065
That's my William.

58
00:07:18,445 --> 00:07:19,737
Oh.

59
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,198
Yes.

60
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:25,743
I think you'll find
the barn comfortable.

61
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:28,746
Never had any complaints
about it from the pigs.

62
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:30,832
Mmm.
Seamus!

63
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:31,999
A word with you.

64
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,084
Aye.

65
00:07:36,797 --> 00:07:39,173
Will you hold him
for a minute?

66
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:45,179
Are you sure you're not after
bringing a curse on this house

67
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,473
taking him in
like that?

68
00:07:47,558 --> 00:07:48,975
He's such
a strange young man.

69
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:52,019
Aye. But I've just got a
feeling about him, Maggie,

70
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,814
that looking after him
is the right thing to do.

71
00:07:54,898 --> 00:07:56,315
That it's important.

72
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,067
Hey, buddy.

73
00:07:58,151 --> 00:08:00,278
Look how the baby
takes to him.

74
00:08:00,362 --> 00:08:04,031
Little Will never
takes to strangers.

75
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:07,034
It's almost as if
he's connected to us.

76
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,119
Hey, Will.

77
00:08:08,745 --> 00:08:11,414
So you're my
great-grandfather.

78
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:13,875
The first McFly
born in America.

79
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:21,424
And you peed on me.

80
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,559
Give us some soap.

81
00:09:13,644 --> 00:09:14,810
Here you go.

82
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,587
Take a look and see what
just breezed in the door.

83
00:11:07,507 --> 00:11:10,009
Why, I didn't know
the circus was in town.

84
00:11:10,093 --> 00:11:13,637
Must have got that
shirt off a dead Chinese.

85
00:11:33,742 --> 00:11:35,326
What will it be,
stranger?

86
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:41,540
I'll have ice water.

87
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,292
Ice water?

88
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,336
Water?

89
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,505
You want water, you
better go dunk your head

90
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:50,174
in the horse trough
out there.

91
00:11:50,258 --> 00:11:53,344
In here,
we pour whiskey.

92
00:12:04,147 --> 00:12:05,397
Excuse me.

93
00:12:05,482 --> 00:12:06,690
For what?

94
00:12:06,775 --> 00:12:09,193
I'm trying to
find the blacksmith.

95
00:12:10,237 --> 00:12:11,695
Hey, McFly!

96
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:16,450
Thought I done told
you never to come in...

97
00:12:18,203 --> 00:12:19,995
You ain't
Seamus McFly.

98
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:23,374
You look like him,
though,

99
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,042
especially with
that dog-ugly hat.

100
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,714
You kin to
that hay barber?

101
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,591
What's your name,
dude?

102
00:12:32,676 --> 00:12:33,968
Marty...

103
00:12:35,095 --> 00:12:36,387
Eastwood.

104
00:12:37,848 --> 00:12:39,348
Clint Eastwood.

105
00:12:41,226 --> 00:12:43,561
What kind of
stupid name is that?

106
00:12:43,645 --> 00:12:45,729
I'd say he's the runt of the litter.

107
00:12:45,814 --> 00:12:48,440
Hey, now, boys, would you take a
look-see at these pearly whites?

108
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:49,817
Hell, I ain't seen
teeth look that straight

109
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:50,943
that weren't
store-bought.

110
00:12:51,027 --> 00:12:52,987
Take a gander at
them moccasins.

111
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:54,572
What kind of skins
is them?

112
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:55,739
What's that
writing mean?

113
00:12:55,824 --> 00:12:57,158
"Nike"?
What is that?

114
00:12:57,242 --> 00:12:58,868
Some sort of Injun
talk or something?

115
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,708
Bartender, I'm looking for that
no-good, cheating blacksmith.

116
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:07,126
You seen him?

117
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,003
No, sir, Mr. Tannen.
I have not.

118
00:13:10,547 --> 00:13:11,839
Tannen.

119
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:14,091
You're "Mad Dog" Tannen.

120
00:13:20,473 --> 00:13:22,266
"Mad Dog"?

121
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,684
I hate that name.

122
00:13:24,686 --> 00:13:27,313
I hate it, you hear?

123
00:13:27,397 --> 00:13:30,274
Nobody calls me
"Mad Dog"!

124
00:13:30,358 --> 00:13:34,278
Especially not some duded-up,
egg-sucking gutter trash.

125
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,324
Dance!

126
00:13:38,408 --> 00:13:39,533
Come on!

127
00:13:41,745 --> 00:13:44,663
Come on, runt! You can
dance better than that!

128
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:55,966
Shit.

129
00:13:57,219 --> 00:13:58,385
Whoo!

130
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:19,406
You better run,
squirrel.

131
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:20,866
Get him!

132
00:14:32,796 --> 00:14:33,963
Whoa!

133
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,433
We got ourselves
a new courthouse.

134
00:15:27,517 --> 00:15:29,059
High time
we had a hanging!

135
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:50,831
Look at him swing.

136
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:57,588
Yeah, haven't had a
hanging in a long time!

137
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,136
It'll shoot the fleas off a
dog's back at 500 yards, Tannen,

138
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,221
and it's pointed
straight at your head!

139
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:18,192
You owe me money,
blacksmith.

140
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:19,693
How do you figure?

141
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,403
My horse threw a shoe.

142
00:16:21,488 --> 00:16:23,030
And seeing as you was the
one that done the shoeing,

143
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:24,490
I say that makes
you responsible.

144
00:16:24,574 --> 00:16:28,535
Well, since you never paid me for
the job, I say that makes us even.

145
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,704
Wrong! See I was
on my horse

146
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,498
when it threw the shoe,
and I got throwed off!

147
00:16:32,582 --> 00:16:34,708
And that caused me
to bust a perfectly

148
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,211
good bottle of
fine Kentucky red eye.

149
00:16:37,295 --> 00:16:39,171
So the way
I figure it, blacksmith,

150
00:16:39,255 --> 00:16:41,131
you owe me $5
for the whiskey

151
00:16:41,216 --> 00:16:43,425
and $75 for the horse!

152
00:16:44,302 --> 00:16:45,386
That's the $80.

153
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,930
Look, if your horse
threw a shoe,

154
00:16:48,014 --> 00:16:49,890
bring him back,
and I'll reshoe him.

155
00:16:49,974 --> 00:16:51,600
I done shot that horse!

156
00:16:51,684 --> 00:16:53,894
Well, that's your problem,
Tannen.

157
00:16:53,978 --> 00:16:57,022
Wrong. That's yours.

158
00:16:57,107 --> 00:17:00,776
So from now on, you better be
looking behind you when you walk.

159
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,487
Because one day you're gonna
get a bullet in your back.

160
00:17:13,498 --> 00:17:14,456
Doc!

161
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:19,670
Marty, I gave you explicit
instructions not to come here

162
00:17:19,754 --> 00:17:21,922
but to go
directly back to 1985.

163
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:24,675
I know, Doc,
but I had to come.

164
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,928
But it's good to
see you, Marty.

165
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:34,143
Marty, you're gonna have to do
something about those clothes.

166
00:17:34,227 --> 00:17:35,602
You walk around town
dressed like that,

167
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,229
you're liable
to get shot.

168
00:17:37,313 --> 00:17:38,272
Or hanged.

169
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:41,483
What idiot dressed you
in that outfit?

170
00:17:41,568 --> 00:17:42,860
You did.

171
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,948
"Shot in the back
by Buford Tannen

172
00:17:48,324 --> 00:17:50,284
"over a matter of $80,

173
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:52,619
"September 7"?

174
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,705
That's this Monday!

175
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:57,291
Now I wish
I'd paid him off.

176
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,126
And who's this
beloved Clara?

177
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,503
I don't know
anyone named Clara.

178
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:04,381
I don't know, Doc.

179
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:06,633
I thought maybe she was
a girlfriend of yours.

180
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:11,972
Marty, my involvement in such a
social relationship here in 1885

181
00:18:12,056 --> 00:18:15,976
could result in a disruption
of the space-time continuum.

182
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:20,105
As a scientist, I can
never take that risk.

183
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:24,276
Certainly not after what
we've already been through.

184
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,486
Emmett!

185
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,737
Hello, Emmett.

186
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:27,946
Hubert.

187
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,698
It's the mayor.

188
00:18:29,782 --> 00:18:31,992
Excuse me, Emmett.

189
00:18:32,076 --> 00:18:34,745
Do you remember last week at the
town meeting when you volunteered

190
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:36,163
to meet the new
schoolteacher

191
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:37,289
at the station
when she came in?

192
00:18:37,373 --> 00:18:38,332
Oh, yes, quite so.

193
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,876
Well, we just got word
she's coming in tomorrow.

194
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,920
Here are the details
for you.

195
00:18:43,004 --> 00:18:44,463
Thanks for
all your help.

196
00:18:44,547 --> 00:18:46,465
Anytime, Hubert.

197
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:50,594
Oh! Her name's Miss
Clayton. Clara Clayton.

198
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:03,273
Well, Doc, now we know who Clara is.

199
00:19:05,026 --> 00:19:07,236
Marty, it's impossible.

200
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,614
The idea that I could fall in love
at first sight is romantic nonsense.

201
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,034
There's no scientific
rationale for that concept.

202
00:19:14,118 --> 00:19:16,119
Aw, come on, Doc.
It's not science.

203
00:19:16,204 --> 00:19:18,705
You meet the right girl, it just
hits you. It's like lightning.

204
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,374
Marty, please
don't say that.

205
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,043
That's the way it was
for me and Jennifer.

206
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:26,088
I mean, we couldn't keep
our eyes off each other.

207
00:19:26,172 --> 00:19:28,215
God, Jennifer, damn. I
hope she's all right, Doc.

208
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:30,634
I can't believe we just
left her there on the porch.

209
00:19:30,718 --> 00:19:32,719
Don't worry, Marty.
She'll be fine.

210
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,888
When you burned
the almanac in 1955,

211
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,557
the normal timeline
was restored.

212
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:38,392
That means once
we're back in 1985,

213
00:19:38,476 --> 00:19:40,477
you just have to go over
to her house to wake her up.

214
00:19:42,355 --> 00:19:44,648
Oh, Marty, turn that valve over there

215
00:19:44,732 --> 00:19:45,774
all the way
to the right.

216
00:19:45,858 --> 00:19:47,734
Yeah, pull it
all the way around.

217
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,319
Okay. Let's go!

218
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:05,043
Iced tea?

219
00:20:05,128 --> 00:20:06,503
No, thanks.

220
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:08,964
It's a refrigerator.

221
00:20:09,048 --> 00:20:10,757
Well, I guess
Miss Clayton

222
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,759
will have to find
other transportation.

223
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:13,844
If I never
meet the woman,

224
00:20:13,928 --> 00:20:16,096
there's no possibility of a
romantic infatuation, right?

225
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,056
You're the doc, Doc.
All right.

226
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:20,684
We'll get the DeLorean and get
ourselves back to the future.

227
00:20:20,768 --> 00:20:22,102
Oh, listen, Doc,
I tore a hole

228
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:23,353
in the gas tank
when I was landing,

229
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:26,023
so we're gonna have to
patch it up and get some gas.

230
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:28,400
You mean we're
out of gas?

231
00:20:28,484 --> 00:20:29,484
Yeah, it's no big deal.

232
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:31,194
We've got
Mr. Fusion, right?

233
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:35,115
Mr. Fusion powers the time
circuits and the Flux Capacitor,

234
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:38,118
but the internal combustion
engine runs on ordinary gasoline.

235
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:39,953
It always has.

236
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,997
There's not gonna be
a gas station around here

237
00:20:42,081 --> 00:20:44,708
until sometime in
the next century.

238
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:46,460
Without gasoline,

239
00:20:46,544 --> 00:20:49,713
we can't get the DeLorean
up to 88 miles per hour.

240
00:20:52,258 --> 00:20:53,675
So what do we do?

241
00:21:04,145 --> 00:21:05,729
Twenty-four!

242
00:21:05,813 --> 00:21:07,356
It's no use, Marty!

243
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,650
Even the fastest
horse in the world

244
00:21:09,734 --> 00:21:12,402
won't run more than 35,
40 miles an hour!

245
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:26,249
Bartender said that's the
strongest stuff they got.

246
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:27,876
Try it, Marty.

247
00:21:39,138 --> 00:21:40,931
Give it more gas!

248
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:51,441
Damn!

249
00:21:53,444 --> 00:21:56,029
It blew the fuel
injection manifold.

250
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,031
Strong stuff,
all right.

251
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:01,034
It will take me a month
to rebuild it.

252
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,494
A month?

253
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:04,621
Doc, you're gonna
get shot on Monday!

254
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:08,250
I know! I know!
I know! I wish...

255
00:22:08,334 --> 00:22:13,046
Wait. I've got it! We can
simply roll it down a steep hill!

256
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:15,048
Oh! We'd never find
a smooth enough surface.

257
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,133
Unless...

258
00:22:16,217 --> 00:22:18,176
Of course! Ice!

259
00:22:18,261 --> 00:22:20,470
We'll wait until winter
when the lake freezes over.

260
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:22,305
Winter? Doc, what are you talking about?

261
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,849
Monday!
It's three days away!

262
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:24,891
All right, all right,
all right.

263
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:28,228
Just let's think this
thing through logically.

264
00:22:28,312 --> 00:22:30,063
We know it won't run
under its own power.

265
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:32,023
We know
we can't pull it.

266
00:22:32,108 --> 00:22:35,569
But if we could
figure out a way

267
00:22:35,653 --> 00:22:38,822
to push it up to
88 miles an hour.

268
00:22:38,906 --> 00:22:40,282
Huh?

269
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:49,541
That's it.

270
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:53,503
How fast can she go? Why,
I've had her up to 55 myself.

271
00:22:54,672 --> 00:22:56,673
I heard that
Fearless Frank Fargo

272
00:22:56,758 --> 00:22:58,091
got one of these
up to near 70

273
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,968
out past
Verde Junction.

274
00:23:00,052 --> 00:23:02,721
Do you think it's possible
to get it up to 90?

275
00:23:02,805 --> 00:23:04,055
Ninety?

276
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,933
Tarnation, son, who'd ever
need to be in such a hurry?

277
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,269
It's just a little bet
he and I have, that's all.

278
00:23:09,353 --> 00:23:11,855
Theoretically speaking,
could it be done?

279
00:23:11,939 --> 00:23:13,774
Well, I suppose,
if you had a straight

280
00:23:13,858 --> 00:23:15,692
stretch of track
with a level grade,

281
00:23:15,777 --> 00:23:18,236
and you weren't hauling
no cars behind you,

282
00:23:18,321 --> 00:23:20,113
and if you could get
the fire hot enough.

283
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:24,159
And I'm talking about hotter than the
blazes of hell and damnation itself.

284
00:23:24,243 --> 00:23:26,453
Then yes, sir, it might be
possible to get her up that fast.

285
00:23:26,537 --> 00:23:28,622
Tell me, when does the next
train come through here?

286
00:23:28,706 --> 00:23:30,123
Monday morning at 8:00.

287
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,793
Here. This spur that
runs off the main line

288
00:23:32,877 --> 00:23:34,377
three miles out
to Clayton Ravine.

289
00:23:34,462 --> 00:23:36,004
It's a long stretch
of level track

290
00:23:36,088 --> 00:23:38,423
that will still
exist in 1985.

291
00:23:38,508 --> 00:23:41,968
This is where we'll push the
DeLorean with the locomotive.

292
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:45,597
Funny. This map calls
Clayton Ravine Shonash Ravine.

293
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:48,809
That must be the old Indian
name for it. It's perfect.

294
00:23:48,893 --> 00:23:50,685
A nice long run
that goes clear across

295
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:51,812
the bridge
over the ravine,

296
00:23:51,896 --> 00:23:54,231
you know, over near that
Hilldale housing development.

297
00:23:54,315 --> 00:23:58,902
Right, Doc, but according to
this map, there is no bridge.

298
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:02,823
Well, Doc,
we can scratch that idea.

299
00:24:02,907 --> 00:24:04,241
I mean, we can't
wait a year and a half

300
00:24:04,325 --> 00:24:05,367
for this thing
to get finished.

301
00:24:05,451 --> 00:24:06,868
Marty, it's perfect.

302
00:24:06,953 --> 00:24:09,079
You're just not thinking
fourth-dimensionally.

303
00:24:09,163 --> 00:24:10,872
Right. Right. I have a
real problem with that.

304
00:24:10,957 --> 00:24:14,835
Don't you see? The
bridge will exist in 1985.

305
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:16,795
It's safe
and still in use.

306
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:19,673
Therefore, as long as we get the
DeLorean up to 88 miles an hour

307
00:24:19,757 --> 00:24:21,466
before we hit
the edge of the ravine,

308
00:24:21,551 --> 00:24:24,010
we'll instantaneously
arrive at a point in time

309
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:26,221
where the bridge
is completed.

310
00:24:26,305 --> 00:24:31,852
We'll have track under us and
coast safely across the ravine.

311
00:24:31,936 --> 00:24:33,103
What about
the locomotive?

312
00:24:33,187 --> 00:24:35,188
It will be
a spectacular wreck.

313
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,148
Too bad no one will
be around to see it.

314
00:24:38,985 --> 00:24:40,861
Help me! Help!

315
00:24:40,945 --> 00:24:42,320
Great Scott!

316
00:25:24,822 --> 00:25:25,906
Hurry!

317
00:25:28,034 --> 00:25:29,326
Jump!

318
00:25:39,629 --> 00:25:40,629
Whoa.

319
00:25:41,464 --> 00:25:42,631
Whoa.

320
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:44,049
Oh...

321
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:46,843
Thank you, sir.
You saved my...

322
00:25:49,096 --> 00:25:50,138
...life.

323
00:25:54,518 --> 00:25:56,937
Emmett Brown at
your service, Miss...

324
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:01,733
Clayton.

325
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:04,527
Clara Clayton.

326
00:26:05,863 --> 00:26:06,863
Clara!

327
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:12,410
What a beautiful name.

328
00:26:29,887 --> 00:26:32,555
May I help you
inside with these?

329
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,350
Oh, no, that won't be
necessary. I can take care of it.

330
00:26:35,434 --> 00:26:37,936
You've done more
than enough already.

331
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,771
But it's really
no trouble.

332
00:26:39,855 --> 00:26:42,232
Doc, she says it's fine,
and we got to get going.

333
00:26:42,316 --> 00:26:46,069
Ma'am, good luck with your
school teaching and everything.

334
00:26:46,153 --> 00:26:49,155
Clara, I'll straighten
everything out

335
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,032
with Mr. Statler for
the buckboard rental.

336
00:26:51,117 --> 00:26:52,450
Don't worry about that.

337
00:26:52,535 --> 00:26:54,577
I feel somewhat responsible
for what happened.

338
00:26:54,662 --> 00:26:55,662
Oh.

339
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,333
That would be very gentlemanly
of you, Mr. Brown. Emmett.

340
00:27:03,212 --> 00:27:05,672
You know,
I'm almost glad

341
00:27:05,756 --> 00:27:07,132
that snake
spooked those horses.

342
00:27:07,216 --> 00:27:10,135
Otherwise,
we might never have met.

343
00:27:10,219 --> 00:27:11,720
I suppose
it was destiny.

344
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:17,434
Well, thank you
for everything.

345
00:27:17,852 --> 00:27:19,728
You're quite welcome.

346
00:27:22,064 --> 00:27:24,691
I will see you again,
won't I?

347
00:27:24,775 --> 00:27:26,026
Of course.
You'll see lots of me.

348
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,569
I'm sure.
I have a shop in town.

349
00:27:27,653 --> 00:27:30,530
I'm the local scientist,
blacksmith.

350
00:27:31,198 --> 00:27:33,950
Science?
What sort of science?

351
00:27:34,035 --> 00:27:35,785
Astronomy?
Chemistry?

352
00:27:36,245 --> 00:27:38,705
Actually, I'm a student
of all sciences.

353
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:41,833
Hey, Doc,
we got to get going.

354
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:44,878
Oh, yes.
Well, excuse us, Clara.

355
00:27:44,962 --> 00:27:46,796
We have to get going.

356
00:27:51,385 --> 00:27:52,469
Toodle-oo.

357
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:02,812
What do you mean, you're gonna
be seeing lots of her, Doc?

358
00:28:02,897 --> 00:28:06,066
Well, I might see her
again just in passing.

359
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,234
Come on, Doc. Did you see the
way she was looking at you?

360
00:28:10,237 --> 00:28:13,323
She did have
quite a scare, right?

361
00:28:13,407 --> 00:28:14,866
After all, Miss Clayton
almost ended up

362
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,868
at the bottom of
Clayton Ravine.

363
00:28:16,952 --> 00:28:17,911
Clayton Ravine.

364
00:28:17,995 --> 00:28:23,124
Holy shit. Hey, Doc, Clayton
Ravine was named after a teacher.

365
00:28:23,209 --> 00:28:25,168
They say she fell in
there 100 years ago.

366
00:28:25,252 --> 00:28:28,088
100 years ago!
That's this year!

367
00:28:28,172 --> 00:28:29,422
Every kid in school
knows that story,

368
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:30,465
'cause we all
have teachers

369
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:32,550
we'd like to see
fall into the ravine.

370
00:28:32,635 --> 00:28:34,094
Great Scott!

371
00:28:35,471 --> 00:28:38,681
Then she was supposed
to go over in that wagon.

372
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,727
Now I may have
seriously altered history.

373
00:28:43,854 --> 00:28:46,898
Look, Doc, what's the
worst that can happen, huh?

374
00:28:46,982 --> 00:28:49,359
So they don't name
the ravine after her.

375
00:28:49,443 --> 00:28:50,568
Let's just get
the DeLorean ready

376
00:28:50,653 --> 00:28:51,778
and get the hell
out of here.

377
00:28:51,862 --> 00:28:55,323
I wish I'd never invented
that infernal time machine.

378
00:28:56,659 --> 00:28:59,410
It's caused
nothing but disaster.

379
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,290
Doc, Doc,
this is Marty.

380
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,458
Do you read me? Over.

381
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:06,584
Check, Marty.

382
00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:09,045
Great, Doc.
These things still work.

383
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,547
All right, Marty.

384
00:29:10,631 --> 00:29:14,092
Once more, let's go over
the entire plan and layout.

385
00:29:14,176 --> 00:29:16,177
I apologize for the crudity
of this model, but I just...

386
00:29:16,262 --> 00:29:19,264
Yeah, I know, Doc. It's not
to scale. It's okay, Doc.

387
00:29:19,348 --> 00:29:22,809
All right.
Tomorrow night, Sunday,

388
00:29:22,893 --> 00:29:25,770
we'll load the DeLorean onto
the tracks here, on the spur

389
00:29:25,855 --> 00:29:28,148
right by the old
abandoned silver mine.

390
00:29:28,232 --> 00:29:31,067
The switch track is where the
spur runs off the main line

391
00:29:31,152 --> 00:29:34,654
three miles out to
Clayton... Shonash Ravine.

392
00:29:34,738 --> 00:29:37,532
The train leaves the station
at 8:00 Monday morning.

393
00:29:37,616 --> 00:29:40,160
We'll stop it here, uncouple
the cars from the tender,

394
00:29:40,244 --> 00:29:42,453
throw the switch track,
and then we'll hijack...

395
00:29:42,538 --> 00:29:46,499
Borrow the locomotive and use
it to push the time machine.

396
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:47,792
According to
my calculations,

397
00:29:47,877 --> 00:29:49,252
we'll reach
88 miles per hour

398
00:29:49,336 --> 00:29:51,337
just before we hit
the edge of the ravine,

399
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:55,091
at which point we'll be
instantaneously transported back to 1985

400
00:29:55,176 --> 00:29:57,594
and coast safely across
the completed bridge.

401
00:29:57,678 --> 00:30:00,430
What does this mean?
"Point of no return. "

402
00:30:00,514 --> 00:30:02,473
That's our
fail-safe point.

403
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:03,933
Up until there, we have
still have enough time

404
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:06,603
to stop the locomotive before
it plunges into the ravine.

405
00:30:06,687 --> 00:30:07,854
But once we
pass this windmill,

406
00:30:07,938 --> 00:30:09,105
it's the future
or bust.

407
00:30:12,109 --> 00:30:15,778
Here you go, Marty. Connect
that to the positive terminal.

408
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,822
All right,
Marty, you all set?

409
00:30:17,907 --> 00:30:19,157
Yeah. Yeah. Go!

410
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:22,285
Train pulling
out of the station!

411
00:30:22,369 --> 00:30:24,537
Coming up to
the switch track!

412
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:27,207
Stop at
the switch track!

413
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:29,542
Throw the switch!

414
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:32,045
Pull up
to the DeLorean!

415
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:36,299
Pushing the DeLorean
up to 88 miles per hour!

416
00:30:42,681 --> 00:30:44,641
It couldn't be simpler.

417
00:30:51,148 --> 00:30:53,149
Emmett?

418
00:30:53,234 --> 00:30:54,817
It's Clara.

419
00:30:54,902 --> 00:30:56,986
Quick,
cover the DeLorean!

420
00:31:04,286 --> 00:31:05,286
Hello.

421
00:31:05,371 --> 00:31:06,579
Why, hello.

422
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:08,790
This is
quite a surprise.

423
00:31:10,334 --> 00:31:12,460
Well, I hope I'm not
disturbing anything.

424
00:31:12,544 --> 00:31:16,089
Oh, no, no, we were just doing
a little model railroading.

425
00:31:16,632 --> 00:31:17,715
Oh.

426
00:31:19,218 --> 00:31:22,262
Emmett, when my bags were
thrown from the wagon,

427
00:31:22,346 --> 00:31:24,222
my telescope
was damaged.

428
00:31:24,306 --> 00:31:27,850
And since you mentioned
an interest in science,

429
00:31:27,935 --> 00:31:31,271
I thought you might be
able to repair it for me.

430
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:33,314
I would pay you,
of course.

431
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:37,694
Oh, no, no, no. I wouldn't
think of charging you for this.

432
00:31:37,778 --> 00:31:39,946
Well, let's have
a look at it.

433
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,282
I think a lens may
be out of alignment,

434
00:31:42,366 --> 00:31:45,910
because if you
move it this way,

435
00:31:45,995 --> 00:31:49,038
the image turns fuzzy.
See?

436
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:54,210
But if you turn it
the other way then...

437
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,963
Everything becomes...

438
00:31:59,883 --> 00:32:01,217
...clear.

439
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:09,142
I could repair it right away
and have it for you tonight.

440
00:32:09,226 --> 00:32:11,978
Oh, tonight is
the town festival.

441
00:32:12,062 --> 00:32:14,647
I wouldn't dream of having
you work on my telescope

442
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,482
during such
an important occasion.

443
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:19,736
You are planning on
attending, aren't you?

444
00:32:20,988 --> 00:32:22,655
Well, actually,
ma'am, I don't think...

445
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,325
Yes, of course,
the festival.

446
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:27,327
Well, in that case,

447
00:32:27,411 --> 00:32:30,955
I'll see you this evening
at the festival, Emmett.

448
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,999
Mr. Eastwood.
Ma'am.

449
00:32:36,086 --> 00:32:38,504
Thank you for taking
care of my telescope.

450
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,465
You're quite welcome.

451
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,847
It's a nice telescope.

452
00:32:47,931 --> 00:32:50,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

453
00:32:50,684 --> 00:32:55,063
as mayor of Hill Valley,
it gives me great pleasure

454
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:58,274
to dedicate this clock to
the people of Hill County!

455
00:32:59,443 --> 00:33:03,196
May it stand
for all time!

456
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,572
Tell me when, gentlemen.

457
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:09,619
Three! Two! One!

458
00:33:10,454 --> 00:33:11,788
Now!

459
00:33:17,252 --> 00:33:19,712
Let the festivities
begin!

460
00:33:27,346 --> 00:33:28,471
You know, Marty,
in a way, it's fitting

461
00:33:28,555 --> 00:33:30,848
that you and I are
here to witness this.

462
00:33:30,933 --> 00:33:33,601
It's too bad I didn't
bring my camera.

463
00:33:40,317 --> 00:33:41,442
Ready, gentlemen?

464
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,239
The only problem is we'll never
be able to show it to anybody.

465
00:33:46,323 --> 00:33:47,490
Smile, Doc.

466
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,160
Yee-ha!

467
00:34:12,266 --> 00:34:14,600
What great music!

468
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:17,395
Yeah, it's got a beat,
and you can dance to it.

469
00:34:17,479 --> 00:34:18,479
Step right up
gentlemen

470
00:34:18,564 --> 00:34:20,481
and test your mettle
with the latest products

471
00:34:20,566 --> 00:34:24,610
from Colonel Samuel Colt's Patent
Firearms Manufacturing Company

472
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,320
of Hartford,
Connecticut.

473
00:34:26,405 --> 00:34:29,323
Now, take this model,
for example.

474
00:34:29,408 --> 00:34:33,077
The new, improved and
refined Colt Peacemaker

475
00:34:33,162 --> 00:34:38,374
selling to you tonight for
the low, low price of $12.

476
00:34:54,516 --> 00:34:56,476
Good evening.
Evening.

477
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:00,146
You look very nice.

478
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,689
Thank you.

479
00:35:10,574 --> 00:35:12,200
Would you like...

480
00:35:14,077 --> 00:35:15,286
Would you care to...

481
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:16,579
I'd love to.

482
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,891
Young man, how about you?
You want to give it a try?

483
00:35:36,975 --> 00:35:40,186
No, no. No, thanks.
Hey, Doc, this...

484
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,278
Son!

485
00:35:50,113 --> 00:35:51,113
Sonny boy!

486
00:35:51,198 --> 00:35:52,657
The Doc can dance?

487
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:59,163
Son. Son. Son!

488
00:35:59,248 --> 00:36:03,668
Hey, I just told you that even
a baby could handle this weapon.

489
00:36:03,752 --> 00:36:06,837
Surely you're not afraid to try
something that a baby could do.

490
00:36:06,922 --> 00:36:08,172
Hey, I'm not afraid
of nothing.

491
00:36:08,257 --> 00:36:11,217
Come on, then. Let's just
step up here like a man.

492
00:36:11,301 --> 00:36:15,721
Now, then what you do is you
just ease that hammer back there

493
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,557
and squeeze off
a round.

494
00:36:17,641 --> 00:36:19,225
No, no, no!

495
00:36:19,309 --> 00:36:22,061
Right on out there
and be real smooth.

496
00:36:22,145 --> 00:36:24,230
That's the way
you do it.

497
00:36:27,693 --> 00:36:29,360
Listen,
can I try that again?

498
00:36:29,444 --> 00:36:30,861
Yeah, go ahead.

499
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,792
Hey, just tell me
one thing.

500
00:36:44,876 --> 00:36:47,420
Where did you learn
to shoot like that?

501
00:36:47,504 --> 00:36:48,838
7- Eleven.

502
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,052
Buford, you sure
that blacksmith

503
00:36:55,137 --> 00:36:56,929
is gonna be at
this here shindig?

504
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,849
Sure he's here.
Everybody's here tonight.

505
00:37:02,436 --> 00:37:04,270
You gentlemen will have
to check your firearms

506
00:37:04,354 --> 00:37:06,606
if you want to join in
on the festivities.

507
00:37:07,941 --> 00:37:09,442
Who's gonna make us,
tenderfoot? You?

508
00:37:09,526 --> 00:37:11,027
I am.

509
00:37:14,072 --> 00:37:16,824
Marshal Strickland. I didn't
know you was back in town.

510
00:37:16,908 --> 00:37:18,534
If you can't
read the sign, Tannen,

511
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:20,870
I presume
you can read this.

512
00:37:21,288 --> 00:37:22,622
Pretty tough hombre
when you're pointing

513
00:37:22,706 --> 00:37:24,040
a scatter gun
at a man's back.

514
00:37:24,124 --> 00:37:27,251
Just like you, Tannen, I take
every advantage I can get.

515
00:37:27,336 --> 00:37:30,004
Now you gonna
check your iron?

516
00:37:30,672 --> 00:37:33,132
I was just joking
with your deputy.

517
00:37:33,216 --> 00:37:34,925
Of course,
I'm gonna check my iron.

518
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,385
We all were.
Weren't we, boys?

519
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:37,803
Yeah, right.

520
00:37:39,431 --> 00:37:40,931
Tannen.

521
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,893
Your knife, too.

522
00:37:50,776 --> 00:37:53,944
Smile, Marshal. After
all, this is a party.

523
00:37:54,029 --> 00:37:56,489
Only party
I'll be smiling at

524
00:37:56,573 --> 00:37:59,241
is the one that sees you
at the end of a rope.

525
00:38:02,162 --> 00:38:03,621
Have fun!

526
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:08,626
See, that's how
you handle them, Son.

527
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,752
Never give them
an inch

528
00:38:09,836 --> 00:38:12,171
and maintain discipline
at all times.

529
00:38:12,255 --> 00:38:15,174
Remember that word,
discipline.

530
00:38:15,258 --> 00:38:16,759
I will, Pa.

531
00:38:17,594 --> 00:38:20,012
Swing that partner
With a right big swing

532
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:22,306
Over to the side
It's the same old thing

533
00:38:22,683 --> 00:38:23,724
Thank you very much.

534
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:28,187
Why, Mr. Eastwood,
nice to see you.

535
00:38:28,271 --> 00:38:32,692
I see you got yourself some respectable
clothes, lad, and a fine hat.

536
00:38:32,776 --> 00:38:33,818
Yeah, well,
a couple people

537
00:38:33,902 --> 00:38:36,112
didn't like the way the
other one looked on me.

538
00:38:36,196 --> 00:38:37,863
Sure, and that one
suits you, Mr. Eastwood.

539
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:39,782
It's very becoming.
Oh, thanks.

540
00:38:40,992 --> 00:38:43,911
Hey, "Frisbie. "
Far out.

541
00:38:46,665 --> 00:38:47,998
What was the meaning
of that?

542
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,709
It was right in front of him. Aye.

543
00:38:49,793 --> 00:38:51,961
Swing that partner
halfway round

544
00:38:52,045 --> 00:38:54,338
Sashay back to
the head of the set

545
00:38:54,423 --> 00:38:57,383
All the way up to
the head of the set

546
00:38:57,467 --> 00:39:00,219
Now, bow to the partner
You're through

547
00:39:04,474 --> 00:39:06,058
Hey, that's mine!
Not anymore.

548
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:07,435
Give me that.

549
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:08,978
There he is, Buford.

550
00:39:10,313 --> 00:39:11,814
Where?
There.

551
00:39:11,898 --> 00:39:14,400
Dancing with that
piece of calico.

552
00:39:14,484 --> 00:39:16,652
What are you
gonna do, boss?

553
00:39:18,572 --> 00:39:21,073
I figure if I bury
this muzzle

554
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:23,868
deep enough in his back,
nobody will hear the shot.

555
00:39:23,952 --> 00:39:26,328
Careful, Buford. You ain't
got but one bullet with that.

556
00:39:26,413 --> 00:39:28,205
I only need one.

557
00:39:39,968 --> 00:39:41,844
I told you to watch
your back, smithy.

558
00:39:41,928 --> 00:39:44,138
Tannen, you're early.

559
00:39:44,222 --> 00:39:46,599
It's a Derringer, smithy.
Small but effective.

560
00:39:46,683 --> 00:39:49,393
The last time I used it, fellow
took two whole days to die.

561
00:39:49,478 --> 00:39:50,478
Bled to death inside.

562
00:39:50,562 --> 00:39:52,271
It was real,
real painful.

563
00:39:52,355 --> 00:39:55,983
That means you'll be dead
by about supper time Monday.

564
00:39:56,067 --> 00:39:59,445
Excuse me. I don't know who you
think you are, but we're dancing.

565
00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:01,655
Well, look at what
we have here.

566
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,282
Ain't you gonna
introduce me to the lady?

567
00:40:03,366 --> 00:40:04,408
I'd like a dance.

568
00:40:04,493 --> 00:40:05,743
I wouldn't give
you the pleasure.

569
00:40:05,827 --> 00:40:08,245
You'll just have to
go ahead and shoot.

570
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,330
All right.

571
00:40:09,414 --> 00:40:10,581
No, no. Emmett,
I'll dance with him.

572
00:40:10,665 --> 00:40:12,458
Boys, keep the
blacksmith company

573
00:40:12,542 --> 00:40:14,460
while I get acquainted
with the filly!

574
00:40:20,675 --> 00:40:24,094
I don't dance very well when my
partner has a gun in his hand.

575
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:26,680
You'll learn.
You'll learn.

576
00:40:26,765 --> 00:40:30,017
You know, smithy, maybe I'll
just take my $80 worth out of her!

577
00:40:30,101 --> 00:40:31,310
Tannen,
leave her alone!

578
00:40:32,729 --> 00:40:34,438
Whoo!

579
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:38,526
Yeah, I bet there's something
you can do that's worth $80.

580
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,321
I believe you've
underestimated me, mister.

581
00:40:42,405 --> 00:40:43,864
Have I?

582
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:48,994
Ow!

583
00:40:51,331 --> 00:40:54,333
Stop it!
Damn you, Tannen!

584
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:56,836
No, I damn you!

585
00:40:58,338 --> 00:41:01,006
I damn you to hell!

586
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:08,806
You.

587
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,474
Hey, lighten up, jerk!

588
00:41:14,604 --> 00:41:16,564
Mighty strong words,
runt!

589
00:41:16,648 --> 00:41:18,107
You man enough
to back them up

590
00:41:18,191 --> 00:41:20,693
with more than
just a pie plate?

591
00:41:23,071 --> 00:41:26,198
Look, just leave
my friends alone.

592
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,742
What's wrong, dude?
You yellow?

593
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:39,169
That's what I thought.
A yellow belly.

594
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:48,178
Nobody calls me yellow.

595
00:41:48,805 --> 00:41:52,099
Then let's
finish it right now.

596
00:41:52,183 --> 00:41:54,935
Not now, Buford.
Marshal's got our guns.

597
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,146
Like I said,
we'll finish this tomorrow!

598
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:00,524
Tomorrow we're robbing
the Pine City stage.

599
00:42:00,609 --> 00:42:03,068
What about Monday?
We doing anything Monday?

600
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:05,112
No, Monday would be fine.
You can kill him on Monday.

601
00:42:05,196 --> 00:42:07,448
I'll be back
this way on Monday.

602
00:42:07,532 --> 00:42:09,116
We'll settle this then.

603
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,911
Right there
out in the street

604
00:42:11,995 --> 00:42:13,329
in front of
the Palace Saloon.

605
00:42:14,956 --> 00:42:17,041
Yeah, right. When?

606
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:19,001
High noon?
Noon?

607
00:42:19,502 --> 00:42:23,297
I do my killing
before breakfast. 7:00!

608
00:42:25,842 --> 00:42:30,554
8:00. I do my killing
after breakfast.

609
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:32,014
Marty!

610
00:42:36,728 --> 00:42:37,770
All right, now.
Break it up.

611
00:42:37,854 --> 00:42:38,896
What's all this about?

612
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,690
You causing
trouble here, Tannen?

613
00:42:41,775 --> 00:42:43,484
No trouble, Marshal.

614
00:42:43,568 --> 00:42:46,862
Just a little personal matter
between me and Eastwood.

615
00:42:47,572 --> 00:42:48,864
This don't
concern the law.

616
00:42:48,949 --> 00:42:51,825
Tonight, everything concerns
the law. Now break it up.

617
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:55,329
Any brawling, it's 15
days in the county jail.

618
00:42:55,413 --> 00:42:57,623
All right, folks.
Come on, this is a party.

619
00:42:57,707 --> 00:42:59,667
Come on!
Let's have some fun!

620
00:43:04,923 --> 00:43:07,132
8:00 Monday, runt.

621
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:08,634
If you ain't here,

622
00:43:08,718 --> 00:43:12,596
I'll hunt you and shoot
you down like a duck.

623
00:43:12,681 --> 00:43:15,849
It's "dog," Buford.
Shoot him down like a dog.

624
00:43:15,934 --> 00:43:20,562
Let's go, boys! Let these
sissies have their party!

625
00:43:21,815 --> 00:43:22,815
Marty,
what are you doing,

626
00:43:22,899 --> 00:43:24,274
saying you're
gonna meet Tannen?

627
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:26,360
Hey, Doc, Doc,
don't worry about it.

628
00:43:26,444 --> 00:43:27,486
Monday morning 8:00 a. m.

629
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:28,904
We're gonna
be gone, right?

630
00:43:28,989 --> 00:43:31,949
Theoretically, yes, but
what if the train's late?

631
00:43:32,033 --> 00:43:33,450
Late? We'll discuss this later.

632
00:43:33,535 --> 00:43:34,702
No, we'll discuss it now.
Late? What do you mean?

633
00:43:34,786 --> 00:43:35,995
Thank you for your
gallantry, Mr. Eastwood.

634
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,329
Hey, ma'am.

635
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,790
Had you not interceded,
Emmett might have been shot.

636
00:43:39,874 --> 00:43:42,626
Marty... Clint, I'm
gonna take Clara home.

637
00:43:42,711 --> 00:43:44,044
Right. Good night,
Doc. Good night, Clara.

638
00:43:44,129 --> 00:43:45,838
You sure set him straight,
Mr. Eastwood.

639
00:43:45,922 --> 00:43:47,006
I'm glad somebody
finally got the gumption

640
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:48,757
to stand up to
that son of a bitch.

641
00:43:48,842 --> 00:43:50,300
You're all right in
my book, Mr. Eastwood.

642
00:43:50,385 --> 00:43:51,593
I'd like to
buy you a drink.

643
00:43:51,678 --> 00:43:52,678
Hey, listen,
I don't want a drink.

644
00:43:52,762 --> 00:43:54,471
You don't have to buy me
anything. Young man. Young man.

645
00:43:54,556 --> 00:43:56,515
It was no big deal. I'd like
for you to have this brand-new

646
00:43:56,599 --> 00:43:59,643
Colt Peacemaker and
gun belt free of charge.

647
00:44:00,937 --> 00:44:02,021
Free?

648
00:44:02,105 --> 00:44:03,522
I want everybody
to know

649
00:44:03,606 --> 00:44:07,401
that the gun that shot Buford
Tannen was a Colt Peacemaker!

650
00:44:07,485 --> 00:44:10,279
Hey, no problem.
Thanks a lot.

651
00:44:10,363 --> 00:44:11,780
Of course
you understand

652
00:44:11,865 --> 00:44:14,241
that if you lose,
I'm taking it back.

653
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:18,954
Thanks again.

654
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,876
You had him,
Mr. Eastwood.

655
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,044
You could have
just walked away,

656
00:44:25,128 --> 00:44:27,379
and nobody would have thought
the less of you for it.

657
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:31,675
All it would have been was
words, hot air from a buffoon.

658
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,427
Instead,
you let him rile you.

659
00:44:33,511 --> 00:44:37,556
Rile you into playing his
game, his way, by his rules.

660
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,017
Seamus, relax.
I know what I'm doing.

661
00:44:40,101 --> 00:44:41,101
He reminds me
of poor Martin.

662
00:44:41,186 --> 00:44:42,186
Aye.

663
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:43,437
Who?
Me brother.

664
00:44:43,521 --> 00:44:44,563
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

665
00:44:44,647 --> 00:44:46,690
You have a brother
named Martin McFly?

666
00:44:46,775 --> 00:44:49,193
Had a brother.

667
00:44:49,277 --> 00:44:51,945
Martin used to let men
provoke him into fighting.

668
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:54,907
He was concerned that people would
think him a coward if he refused.

669
00:44:54,991 --> 00:44:57,367
That's how he got a Bowie
knife shoved through his belly

670
00:44:57,452 --> 00:45:00,329
in a saloon
in Virginia City.

671
00:45:00,413 --> 00:45:02,247
Never considered
the future, poor Martin.

672
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:04,249
God rest his soul.

673
00:45:05,752 --> 00:45:09,588
Sure, and I hope you're considering
the future, Mr. Eastwood.

674
00:45:12,842 --> 00:45:15,344
I think about it
all the time.

675
00:45:16,221 --> 00:45:17,930
And that crater
in the middle north west,

676
00:45:18,014 --> 00:45:19,932
the one that's out there all
by itself like a starburst...

677
00:45:20,016 --> 00:45:21,058
Uh-huh.

678
00:45:21,142 --> 00:45:23,393
...that one's
called Copernicus.

679
00:45:24,395 --> 00:45:26,855
Listen to me. I feel
like I'm teaching school.

680
00:45:28,024 --> 00:45:30,526
Please,
continue the lesson.

681
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:33,612
I never found lunar
geography so fascinating.

682
00:45:33,696 --> 00:45:35,781
You're quite
knowledgeable.

683
00:45:35,865 --> 00:45:37,616
When I was 11,
I had diphtheria.

684
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,701
I was quarantined
for three months.

685
00:45:39,786 --> 00:45:41,870
So my father
brought this telescope,

686
00:45:41,955 --> 00:45:43,330
and he put it
next to my bed

687
00:45:43,414 --> 00:45:45,958
so I could see
everything out the window.

688
00:45:47,127 --> 00:45:50,462
Emmett, do you think we'll ever
be able to travel to the moon

689
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:53,632
the way we travel across
the country on trains?

690
00:45:53,716 --> 00:45:57,136
Definitely. Although not for
84 years and not on trains.

691
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:01,056
We'll have space vehicles,
capsules sent aloft with rockets.

692
00:46:01,141 --> 00:46:02,975
Devices that
create giant explosions.

693
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:05,477
Explosions so powerful
that they just...

694
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:07,646
That they break the pull
of the Earth's gravity

695
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:10,983
and send the projectile
through outer space.

696
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:14,778
Emmett,
I read that book, too!

697
00:46:14,863 --> 00:46:16,864
You're quoting
Jules Verne

698
00:46:16,948 --> 00:46:18,407
From the Earth
to the Moon.

699
00:46:18,491 --> 00:46:20,742
You've read Jules Verne?

700
00:46:21,536 --> 00:46:23,453
I adore Jules Verne.

701
00:46:23,538 --> 00:46:25,164
So do I.

702
00:46:25,248 --> 00:46:28,125
Twenty Thousand Leagues Under
the Sea. My absolute favorite.

703
00:46:28,209 --> 00:46:30,127
The first time I read that
when I was a little boy,

704
00:46:30,211 --> 00:46:32,796
why, I wanted to
meet Captain Nemo.

705
00:46:32,881 --> 00:46:34,047
Don't tease, Emmett.

706
00:46:34,132 --> 00:46:36,008
You couldn't have read
that when you were a boy.

707
00:46:36,092 --> 00:46:38,510
It was only first
published 10 years ago.

708
00:46:38,761 --> 00:46:42,639
Oh, yes. Well, I meant it
made me feel like a boy.

709
00:46:44,934 --> 00:46:49,563
I never met a woman who
liked Jules Verne before.

710
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:55,027
I never ever met a man
like you before.

711
00:47:47,413 --> 00:47:54,419
Doc?

712
00:47:57,423 --> 00:47:59,800
Hope you know
what you're doing.

713
00:48:13,022 --> 00:48:14,856
You talking to me?

714
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:19,861
You talking to me,
Tannen?

715
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,285
Well, I'm the
only one here.

716
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:30,038
Go ahead,
make my day.

717
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,046
Say good morning,
Mr. Eastwood.

718
00:48:38,131 --> 00:48:39,423
Morning.

719
00:48:39,507 --> 00:48:41,133
Have a cigar,
Mr. Eastwood.

720
00:48:41,217 --> 00:48:43,719
Anything I can do for
you today, Mr. Eastwood?

721
00:48:43,803 --> 00:48:45,345
No, that's fine.

722
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:46,972
Good luck tomorrow,
Mr. Eastwood.

723
00:48:47,056 --> 00:48:48,640
We'll be praying
for you.

724
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:49,766
Thanks.

725
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:53,145
Good morning,
Mr. Eastwood.

726
00:48:53,229 --> 00:48:55,230
Interest you in a new suit for tomorrow?

727
00:48:57,275 --> 00:48:59,276
I'm fine. Thanks.

728
00:49:10,413 --> 00:49:12,497
Doc, what are
you doing?

729
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:13,957
Oh, nothing.

730
00:49:14,042 --> 00:49:16,626
I was just out
enjoying the morning air.

731
00:49:16,711 --> 00:49:19,046
It's really lovely here in
the morning. Don't you think?

732
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:20,172
Yeah, it's lovely, Doc.

733
00:49:20,256 --> 00:49:21,506
So listen, we've got
to load the DeLorean up

734
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:23,175
and get ready
to roll, all right?

735
00:49:23,259 --> 00:49:25,761
Hey, look at that,
the tombstone.

736
00:49:27,472 --> 00:49:30,349
Marty, let me see
that photograph again.

737
00:49:32,143 --> 00:49:34,936
My name,
it's vanished.

738
00:49:35,021 --> 00:49:37,397
Hey, that's great, Doc.
Don't you get it?

739
00:49:37,482 --> 00:49:38,565
We're going back to
the future tomorrow,

740
00:49:38,649 --> 00:49:39,983
so everything's
being erased.

741
00:49:40,068 --> 00:49:41,860
But only my name
is erased.

742
00:49:41,944 --> 00:49:43,695
The tombstone itself
and the date still remain.

743
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,697
That doesn't
make sense.

744
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:48,367
We know that this photograph
represents what will happen

745
00:49:48,451 --> 00:49:49,868
if the events
of today continue

746
00:49:49,952 --> 00:49:51,787
to run their course
into tomorrow.

747
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,871
Right. So?

748
00:49:52,955 --> 00:49:54,206
Excuse me,
Mr. Eastwood.

749
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:55,707
I just need to take
your measurements.

750
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:57,834
Oh, look, pal, I don't
want to buy a suit.

751
00:49:59,003 --> 00:50:01,129
No, this is
for your coffin.

752
00:50:01,214 --> 00:50:02,255
My coffin?

753
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,800
Well, the odds are running
two to one against you.

754
00:50:04,884 --> 00:50:07,219
Might as well
be prepared.

755
00:50:07,303 --> 00:50:10,764
So it may not be my name that's
supposed to end up on this tombstone.

756
00:50:10,848 --> 00:50:12,599
It may be yours.

757
00:50:13,851 --> 00:50:14,893
Great Scott.

758
00:50:14,977 --> 00:50:15,936
I know.
This is heavy.

759
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,979
Marty, why are you
wearing that gun?

760
00:50:18,064 --> 00:50:20,148
You're not considering going
up against Tannen tomorrow?

761
00:50:20,233 --> 00:50:23,068
Doc, tomorrow morning I'm going
back to the future with you.

762
00:50:23,152 --> 00:50:24,903
But if Buford Tannen
comes looking for trouble,

763
00:50:24,987 --> 00:50:26,571
I'm gonna be
ready for him.

764
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:29,032
You heard what that son of
a bitch called me last night.

765
00:50:29,117 --> 00:50:30,367
Marty, you can't go
losing your judgment

766
00:50:30,451 --> 00:50:31,910
every time someone
calls you a name.

767
00:50:31,994 --> 00:50:32,994
That's exactly
what causes you

768
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:36,331
to get into that accident
in the future.

769
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:41,420
What?
What about my future?

770
00:50:41,504 --> 00:50:44,631
I can't tell you. It
might make things worse.

771
00:50:44,715 --> 00:50:48,510
Wait a minute. Doc, what
is wrong with my future?

772
00:50:49,429 --> 00:50:51,638
Marty, we all have to make decisions

773
00:50:51,722 --> 00:50:54,099
that affect
the course of our lives.

774
00:50:54,183 --> 00:50:57,102
You've got to do
what you've got to do,

775
00:50:57,186 --> 00:50:59,020
and I've got to do
what I've got to do.

776
00:51:10,533 --> 00:51:12,576
Marty.
Yeah.

777
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,453
I've made a decision.
Uh-huh.

778
00:51:14,537 --> 00:51:15,579
I'm not going
with you tomorrow.

779
00:51:16,747 --> 00:51:18,457
I'm staying here.

780
00:51:21,836 --> 00:51:24,671
What are you
talking about, Doc?

781
00:51:24,755 --> 00:51:26,631
There's no point
in denying it.

782
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:27,799
I'm in love with Clara.

783
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:29,259
Oh, man.

784
00:51:29,343 --> 00:51:33,430
Doc, we don't belong
here. Neither one of us.

785
00:51:33,514 --> 00:51:36,391
You know, it could still be
you that gets shot tomorrow.

786
00:51:36,476 --> 00:51:39,019
This tombstone could
still be in your future.

787
00:51:39,103 --> 00:51:42,439
Marty, the future
isn't written.

788
00:51:42,523 --> 00:51:44,941
It can be changed.
You know that.

789
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:50,030
Anyone can make their future
whatever they want it to be.

790
00:51:50,114 --> 00:51:51,823
I can't let this
one little photograph

791
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:54,493
determine
my entire destiny.

792
00:51:54,577 --> 00:51:55,827
I have to
live my life

793
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:59,748
according to what I believe
is right in my heart.

794
00:52:02,084 --> 00:52:04,961
Doc, you're a scientist.

795
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:11,426
So you tell me. What's the
right thing to do up here?

796
00:52:25,274 --> 00:52:26,650
You're right, Marty.

797
00:52:49,549 --> 00:52:50,715
Wow, that worked great.

798
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,718
I've at least got
to tell her goodbye.

799
00:52:54,637 --> 00:52:57,597
Come on, Doc.
Think about it.

800
00:52:57,682 --> 00:52:59,057
What are you
gonna say to her?

801
00:52:59,141 --> 00:53:00,559
"I've got to go
back to the future?"

802
00:53:00,643 --> 00:53:02,894
I mean, she's not gonna
understand that, Doc.

803
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:04,020
Hell, I'm in it
with you,

804
00:53:04,105 --> 00:53:06,648
and I don't
even understand it.

805
00:53:09,235 --> 00:53:12,195
Doc, listen.

806
00:53:13,489 --> 00:53:15,073
Maybe we...

807
00:53:15,157 --> 00:53:18,535
I don't know, maybe we can
just take Clara with us.

808
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,162
To the future?

809
00:53:25,418 --> 00:53:28,086
As you reminded me,
Marty, I'm a scientist,

810
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:30,839
so I must be
scientific about this.

811
00:53:30,923 --> 00:53:32,757
I cautioned you about
disrupting the continuum

812
00:53:32,842 --> 00:53:34,175
for your own
personal benefit.

813
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,511
Therefore,
I must do no less.

814
00:53:36,596 --> 00:53:37,721
We shall proceed
as planned,

815
00:53:37,805 --> 00:53:39,764
and as soon as
we return to 1985,

816
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:43,351
we'll destroy this
infernal machine.

817
00:53:43,436 --> 00:53:46,896
Traveling through time has
become much too painful.

818
00:54:17,345 --> 00:54:19,137
It's Emmett, Clara.

819
00:54:23,225 --> 00:54:25,977
Emmett,
won't you come in?

820
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:29,189
No, I better not. I...

821
00:54:31,442 --> 00:54:32,734
What's wrong?

822
00:54:34,236 --> 00:54:35,779
I've come
to say goodbye.

823
00:54:37,573 --> 00:54:40,075
Goodbye? Well,
where are you going?

824
00:54:40,743 --> 00:54:42,661
I'm going away.

825
00:54:42,745 --> 00:54:45,413
And well, I'm afraid
I'll never see you again.

826
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:48,249
Emmett!

827
00:54:48,334 --> 00:54:53,546
Clara, I want you to know
that I care about you deeply.

828
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:56,257
But I've realized that
I don't belong here,

829
00:54:56,342 --> 00:55:00,011
and I have to go back
where I came from.

830
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:02,639
And where
might that be?

831
00:55:02,723 --> 00:55:04,432
I can't tell you.

832
00:55:06,727 --> 00:55:10,522
Well, wherever you're
going, take me with you.

833
00:55:11,857 --> 00:55:14,109
I can't, Clara.

834
00:55:14,193 --> 00:55:15,527
I wish it didn't
have to be this way,

835
00:55:15,611 --> 00:55:17,153
but just believe me
when I tell you

836
00:55:17,238 --> 00:55:21,658
that I'll never forget you
and that I love you.

837
00:55:23,828 --> 00:55:26,079
I don't understand what
you're trying to say.

838
00:55:26,163 --> 00:55:30,083
Clara, I don't think there's any
way that you can understand it.

839
00:55:30,793 --> 00:55:33,169
Please, Emmett.
Please, I have to know.

840
00:55:33,254 --> 00:55:34,879
If you sincerely
do love me,

841
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:36,297
then tell me
the truth.

842
00:55:38,384 --> 00:55:40,051
All right then.

843
00:55:41,095 --> 00:55:42,303
I'm from the future.

844
00:55:44,348 --> 00:55:47,350
I came here in a time
machine that I invented,

845
00:55:47,435 --> 00:55:51,479
and tomorrow I have to
go back to the year 1985.

846
00:55:57,737 --> 00:55:59,154
Yes, Emmett.

847
00:56:00,573 --> 00:56:02,240
I do understand.

848
00:56:04,827 --> 00:56:07,162
I understand that
because you know

849
00:56:07,246 --> 00:56:09,539
I'm partial to the
writings of Jules Verne,

850
00:56:09,623 --> 00:56:11,040
you concocted
those mendacities

851
00:56:11,125 --> 00:56:13,168
in order to take
advantage of me.

852
00:56:14,128 --> 00:56:16,588
Oh! I've heard some
whoppers in my day,

853
00:56:16,672 --> 00:56:17,797
but the fact
that you'd expect me

854
00:56:17,882 --> 00:56:19,174
to entertain
a notion like that

855
00:56:19,258 --> 00:56:22,010
is so insulting
and degrading!

856
00:56:23,804 --> 00:56:25,597
All you had to say is,
"I don't love you,

857
00:56:25,681 --> 00:56:27,766
"and I don't want
to see you anymore. "

858
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:30,310
That, at least, would
have been respectful!

859
00:56:31,061 --> 00:56:32,395
But that's
not the truth.

860
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:13,937
Good to
see you, too.

861
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:18,775
Emmett. What can I get you? The usual?

862
00:57:18,859 --> 00:57:20,443
No, Chester, I'm gonna need something

863
00:57:20,528 --> 00:57:22,654
a lot stronger
than that tonight.

864
00:57:22,738 --> 00:57:24,155
Sarsaparilla.

865
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,615
Whiskey, Chester.

866
00:57:26,492 --> 00:57:28,910
Whiskey?
Emmett, are you sure?

867
00:57:28,994 --> 00:57:31,329
You know what happened to
you on the Fourth of July.

868
00:57:31,413 --> 00:57:32,622
Whiskey.

869
00:57:33,999 --> 00:57:37,210
Okay, I ain't your papa.

870
00:57:37,294 --> 00:57:40,547
Just don't want to see
you do the wrong thing.

871
00:57:41,882 --> 00:57:43,925
You can leave
the bottle.

872
00:57:45,761 --> 00:57:47,595
It's a woman, right?

873
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:51,516
I knew it. I have seen
that look on a man's face

874
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,477
a thousand times
all across the country.

875
00:57:54,562 --> 00:57:56,896
All I can tell you, friend,
is you'll get over her.

876
00:57:56,981 --> 00:58:00,441
Oh... Clara was
one in a million.

877
00:58:01,485 --> 00:58:05,738
One in a billion.
One in a googolplex.

878
00:58:05,823 --> 00:58:09,450
The woman of my dreams, and
I've lost her for all time.

879
00:58:10,744 --> 00:58:14,205
I can assure you, sir,
there are other women.

880
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:16,916
Why, peddling this barbed
wire all across the country

881
00:58:17,001 --> 00:58:19,335
has taught me
one thing for certain,

882
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:22,380
is that you never know
what the future might bring.

883
00:58:22,464 --> 00:58:26,342
The future. Oh, I can
tell you about the future.

884
00:58:36,812 --> 00:58:38,771
Oh, man, did I sleep.

885
00:58:41,817 --> 00:58:43,651
What time is it, Doc?

886
00:58:47,656 --> 00:58:48,823
Doc?

887
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:01,419
Wake up!

888
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:05,089
Get up! Let's go!

889
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:08,343
I got me
a runt to kill.

890
00:59:08,427 --> 00:59:11,387
It's still early, boss.
What's your hurry?

891
00:59:12,431 --> 00:59:13,723
I'm hungry.

892
00:59:14,516 --> 00:59:17,560
And in the future,
we don't need horses.

893
00:59:19,271 --> 00:59:22,690
We have motorized carriages
called automobiles.

894
00:59:23,859 --> 00:59:27,236
If everybody's got one
of these auto whatsits,

895
00:59:27,321 --> 00:59:29,739
does anybody walk
or run anymore?

896
00:59:30,407 --> 00:59:34,327
Of course we run, but
for recreation, for fun.

897
00:59:34,411 --> 00:59:38,081
Run for fun? What the
hell kind of fun is that?

898
00:59:48,342 --> 00:59:50,551
Doc! Doc!

899
00:59:57,393 --> 00:59:59,185
How much
has he had?

900
00:59:59,269 --> 01:00:00,979
None.
That's the first one,

901
01:00:01,063 --> 01:00:02,563
and he hasn't
touched it yet.

902
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:04,983
He just likes
to hold it.

903
01:00:08,529 --> 01:00:11,489
Doc! Doc!
What are you doing?

904
01:00:12,491 --> 01:00:15,785
I've lost her, Marty. There's
nothing left for me here.

905
01:00:15,869 --> 01:00:17,787
All right, that's why you
gotta come back with me.

906
01:00:17,871 --> 01:00:18,830
Where?

907
01:00:18,914 --> 01:00:20,123
Back to the future!

908
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,337
Right!
Let's get going!

909
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:27,505
Great.

910
01:00:27,589 --> 01:00:30,758
Gentlemen, excuse me, but my
friend and I have to catch a train.

911
01:00:30,843 --> 01:00:32,552
Here's to you,
blacksmith.

912
01:00:32,636 --> 01:00:33,928
And to the future.

913
01:00:34,013 --> 01:00:35,054
Amen.

914
01:00:35,514 --> 01:00:37,098
Amen.
Emmett, no!

915
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:48,234
Doc! Doc! Doc!

916
01:00:49,153 --> 01:00:52,196
Come on, Doc.
Wake up. Wake up, Doc!

917
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,198
How many did he have?

918
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:55,408
Just the one.

919
01:00:55,492 --> 01:00:57,618
Just the one?
Come on, Doc.

920
01:00:57,703 --> 01:00:59,954
There's a fellow that
can't hold his liquor.

921
01:01:00,039 --> 01:01:01,706
Get me some coffee.
Black!

922
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:02,915
Joey, coffee!

923
01:01:12,926 --> 01:01:15,053
Ma'am?

924
01:01:15,137 --> 01:01:17,055
How far does
the 8:00 train go?

925
01:01:17,139 --> 01:01:19,474
San Francisco is
the end of the line.

926
01:01:21,143 --> 01:01:23,311
I'll take
a one-way ticket.

927
01:01:24,646 --> 01:01:26,689
You want to sober him
up in a hurry, son,

928
01:01:26,774 --> 01:01:28,733
you're gonna have to use something
a lot stronger than coffee.

929
01:01:28,817 --> 01:01:31,444
Yeah,
what do you suggest?

930
01:01:31,528 --> 01:01:34,906
Joey, let's make
some wake-up juice.

931
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:37,492
Come on, Doc, swallow.
Here we go.

932
01:01:42,581 --> 01:01:44,582
In about 10 minutes,

933
01:01:44,666 --> 01:01:47,668
he's gonna be as sober
as a priest on Sunday.

934
01:01:48,712 --> 01:01:49,879
Ten minutes!

935
01:01:49,963 --> 01:01:52,423
Why do we have to cut
these things so damn close?

936
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:55,218
Here, stick this
clothespin on his nose.

937
01:01:57,096 --> 01:01:59,180
When he opens up
his mouth,

938
01:01:59,264 --> 01:02:02,725
go ahead and pour it on down his gullet.

939
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:04,519
Oh, and stand back.

940
01:02:22,996 --> 01:02:23,996
He's still out!

941
01:02:24,081 --> 01:02:26,290
Oh, that? That was
just a reflex action.

942
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:27,792
It's gonna take
a few more minutes

943
01:02:27,876 --> 01:02:29,710
for the stuff to really
clear up his head.

944
01:02:29,795 --> 01:02:31,003
Perfect.

945
01:02:52,276 --> 01:02:54,402
Come on, Doc.
Come on, wake up, buddy.

946
01:02:54,486 --> 01:02:57,363
Wake up, Doc!
Come on. Come on.

947
01:02:57,447 --> 01:03:00,032
Seamus, wouldn't expect to
see you here this morning.

948
01:03:00,117 --> 01:03:04,078
Aye. Something inside me
told me I should be here

949
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:08,249
as if my future had
something to do with it.

950
01:03:09,918 --> 01:03:12,378
He'll come around
in a minute. Come on.

951
01:03:12,462 --> 01:03:14,422
Come on, Doc.
Let's go, Doc!

952
01:03:14,506 --> 01:03:16,424
Let's wake up now, buddy.
Come on.

953
01:03:23,473 --> 01:03:25,766
Are you in there,
Eastwood?

954
01:03:27,728 --> 01:03:30,771
It's 8:00,
and I'm calling you out.

955
01:03:35,736 --> 01:03:37,403
It's not 8:00 yet!

956
01:03:37,821 --> 01:03:39,780
It is by my watch!

957
01:03:39,865 --> 01:03:42,783
Let's settle this
once and for all, runt!

958
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:46,746
Or ain't you
got the gumption?

959
01:03:56,215 --> 01:03:57,465
Listen.

960
01:03:59,968 --> 01:04:02,803
I'm not really feeling up to this today.

961
01:04:04,389 --> 01:04:06,015
So I'm gonna
have to forfeit.

962
01:04:06,683 --> 01:04:08,976
Forfeit?

963
01:04:09,603 --> 01:04:11,354
What's that mean?

964
01:04:12,731 --> 01:04:14,732
It means that you win
without a fight.

965
01:04:14,816 --> 01:04:16,609
Without shooting?
He can't do that.

966
01:04:16,693 --> 01:04:18,819
Hey, you can't do that!

967
01:04:18,904 --> 01:04:20,404
You know what I think?

968
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:23,824
I think you ain't nothing
but a gutless, yellow turd!

969
01:04:23,909 --> 01:04:26,369
And I'm giving you
to the count of 10

970
01:04:26,453 --> 01:04:28,579
to come out here
and prove I'm wrong!

971
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:30,790
One!

972
01:04:30,874 --> 01:04:33,459
Doc, come on, sober up,
buddy. Let's go. Come on.

973
01:04:33,543 --> 01:04:34,585
Two!

974
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:35,920
You better get
out there, son.

975
01:04:36,004 --> 01:04:39,131
I got $20 gold bet on
you, so don't let me down.

976
01:04:39,216 --> 01:04:40,424
Three!

977
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:44,720
I got $30 gold bet against
you, so don't let me down.

978
01:04:44,805 --> 01:04:45,805
Four!

979
01:04:45,889 --> 01:04:47,848
You better face
up to it, son,

980
01:04:47,933 --> 01:04:50,351
because if you
don't go out there...

981
01:04:50,435 --> 01:04:51,894
What?
Five!

982
01:04:53,397 --> 01:04:54,981
What if I don't
go out there?

983
01:04:55,065 --> 01:04:56,315
You're a coward.

984
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,483
Six!

985
01:04:57,567 --> 01:05:00,736
And you'll be branded a coward
for the rest of your days!

986
01:05:00,821 --> 01:05:04,949
Everybody everywhere
will say Clint Eastwood

987
01:05:05,033 --> 01:05:07,743
is the biggest yellow belly in the West!

988
01:05:12,874 --> 01:05:13,916
Seven!

989
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,085
Here!

990
01:05:20,215 --> 01:05:21,382
Eight!

991
01:05:30,225 --> 01:05:31,434
I already got a gun.

992
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,770
Nine!

993
01:05:39,609 --> 01:05:40,651
Ten!

994
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:47,450
Do you hear me, runt?

995
01:05:47,534 --> 01:05:51,746
I said that's 10, you
gutless, yellow pie-slinger!

996
01:05:55,417 --> 01:05:57,668
He's an asshole!

997
01:05:57,753 --> 01:05:59,712
I don't care
what Tannen says!

998
01:05:59,796 --> 01:06:02,757
And I don't care what
anybody else says either.

999
01:06:03,884 --> 01:06:05,217
Doc! Doc, you okay?

1000
01:06:05,302 --> 01:06:06,344
I think so.

1001
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:09,055
What a headache!

1002
01:06:09,139 --> 01:06:10,890
Listen, you got a back
door to this place?

1003
01:06:10,974 --> 01:06:12,016
Yeah, it's in the back.

1004
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:13,142
Let's go, Doc.

1005
01:06:13,226 --> 01:06:16,771
Are you coming out here, or
do I have to come in after you?

1006
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:20,608
The thing I really
miss here is Tylenol.

1007
01:06:21,485 --> 01:06:22,610
Hey!

1008
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:30,159
Reach, blacksmith!

1009
01:06:47,135 --> 01:06:49,845
Yes, sir, that poor fellow last night

1010
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:53,891
had the worst case of broken
heart I have ever seen.

1011
01:06:53,975 --> 01:06:55,226
When he said
he didn't know

1012
01:06:55,310 --> 01:06:57,019
how he could live
the rest of his life

1013
01:06:57,104 --> 01:06:59,897
knowing how much hurt he'd
caused that little girl.

1014
01:06:59,981 --> 01:07:04,026
Well, I really felt for
him. I did. Right here.

1015
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:10,574
Listen up, Eastwood!

1016
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:12,201
I aim to shoot
somebody today,

1017
01:07:12,285 --> 01:07:14,078
and I prefer
it'd be you.

1018
01:07:14,162 --> 01:07:16,705
But if you're
just too damn yellow,

1019
01:07:16,790 --> 01:07:19,250
I guess it'll just have to
be your blacksmith friend.

1020
01:07:19,334 --> 01:07:21,752
Forget about me, Marty,
and save yourself!

1021
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,926
You got one minute
to decide.

1022
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:31,345
You hear me, runt?
One minute!

1023
01:07:34,558 --> 01:07:37,560
I've never seen a man so
broken up over a woman.

1024
01:07:37,644 --> 01:07:40,271
What did he say her
name was? Cara? Sara?

1025
01:07:40,355 --> 01:07:41,897
Clara.
Clara.

1026
01:07:45,193 --> 01:07:46,944
Excuse me.
Ma'am?

1027
01:07:48,113 --> 01:07:51,449
But was this man tall with
great big, brown puppy-dog eyes

1028
01:07:51,533 --> 01:07:54,034
and long silvery,
flowing hair?

1029
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:55,327
You know him.

1030
01:07:58,206 --> 01:07:59,290
Emmett!

1031
01:08:14,139 --> 01:08:16,015
Time's up, runt!

1032
01:08:22,105 --> 01:08:24,940
Prepare to meet
your maker, blacksmith.

1033
01:08:25,025 --> 01:08:26,817
Right here, Tannen!

1034
01:09:04,606 --> 01:09:05,648
Draw!

1035
01:09:08,985 --> 01:09:10,110
No!

1036
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:28,254
I thought we could
settle this like men.

1037
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:31,799
You thought wrong, dude.

1038
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:55,447
Thank you.

1039
01:10:59,012 --> 01:11:00,763
That was good.

1040
01:11:03,558 --> 01:11:05,517
You know what I think? No.

1041
01:11:05,602 --> 01:11:06,810
I think Buford's
going to jail.

1042
01:11:06,895 --> 01:11:08,020
Yeah.

1043
01:11:13,693 --> 01:11:15,778
Get him out
of that shit.

1044
01:11:15,862 --> 01:11:17,404
Get them!

1045
01:11:21,409 --> 01:11:23,994
Buford Tannen,
you're under arrest

1046
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:26,038
for robbing
the Pine City stage.

1047
01:11:26,122 --> 01:11:28,248
You got anything to say?

1048
01:11:33,421 --> 01:11:35,214
I hate manure.

1049
01:11:35,298 --> 01:11:36,340
Look!

1050
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:41,345
Yes!

1051
01:11:42,806 --> 01:11:43,806
The train!

1052
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:45,099
Can we make it?

1053
01:11:45,183 --> 01:11:47,101
We'll have to cut them
off at Coyote Pass.

1054
01:11:49,604 --> 01:11:52,398
Hey! Hey, mister.
Mr. Eastwood.

1055
01:11:52,482 --> 01:11:53,691
Here's your gun, mister.

1056
01:11:53,775 --> 01:11:54,942
Thanks, kid.

1057
01:12:00,281 --> 01:12:01,990
Seamus!

1058
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:05,077
It's worth $12.
Never been used.

1059
01:12:06,496 --> 01:12:08,580
Maybe I'll trade it
for a new hat.

1060
01:12:08,665 --> 01:12:10,999
Right, and take care of that baby!

1061
01:12:12,210 --> 01:12:13,460
I will!

1062
01:12:20,135 --> 01:12:27,766
Emmett!

1063
01:12:32,647 --> 01:12:34,314
"Time machine. "

1064
01:13:17,776 --> 01:13:18,776
Come on, Marty!

1065
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:23,530
Go, Doc.

1066
01:13:23,615 --> 01:13:25,365
Come on.
Give me your hand!

1067
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:02,277
Come on, Marty.

1068
01:14:06,783 --> 01:14:08,242
Come on. Let's go!

1069
01:14:16,918 --> 01:14:18,252
Masks on.

1070
01:14:33,434 --> 01:14:34,643
Reach!

1071
01:14:34,727 --> 01:14:35,894
Is this a holdup?

1072
01:14:37,897 --> 01:14:40,315
It's a science experiment.

1073
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,235
Stop the train just before you
hit the switch track up ahead.

1074
01:14:59,085 --> 01:15:00,085
Doc!

1075
01:15:00,169 --> 01:15:02,170
Uncouple the cars
from the tender!

1076
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:31,533
I've wanted to
do that all my life.

1077
01:16:04,984 --> 01:16:06,234
What are these things,
anyway?

1078
01:16:06,319 --> 01:16:08,153
My own version
of Pres-to-Logs.

1079
01:16:08,237 --> 01:16:09,613
Compressed wood
with anthracite dust

1080
01:16:09,697 --> 01:16:11,949
chemically treated to
burn hotter and longer.

1081
01:16:12,033 --> 01:16:14,451
I use them in my forge
so I don't have to stoke it.

1082
01:16:14,535 --> 01:16:16,536
These three in the furnace
will ignite sequentially,

1083
01:16:16,621 --> 01:16:18,038
make the fire
burn hotter,

1084
01:16:18,122 --> 01:16:19,289
kick up
the boiler pressure,

1085
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:20,749
and make the train
go faster.

1086
01:16:32,637 --> 01:16:34,471
Ready to roll!

1087
01:17:06,129 --> 01:17:07,421
Emmett!

1088
01:17:12,093 --> 01:17:14,553
Marty, are the
time circuits on?

1089
01:17:15,763 --> 01:17:16,763
Check, Doc!

1090
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:19,516
Input the destination time.

1091
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:23,311
October 27, 1985,
11:00 a. m.

1092
01:17:24,731 --> 01:17:29,067
Check. Okay, we're cruising at
a steady 25 miles an hour, Doc.

1093
01:17:29,152 --> 01:17:30,944
I'm throwing in
the Pres-to-Logs.

1094
01:17:40,621 --> 01:17:42,414
Marty, the new gauge
on the dashboard

1095
01:17:42,498 --> 01:17:44,082
will tell us
the boiler temperature.

1096
01:17:44,167 --> 01:17:47,544
It's color-coded to indicate
when each log will fire.

1097
01:17:47,628 --> 01:17:49,129
Green, yellow and red.

1098
01:17:49,964 --> 01:17:51,548
Each detonation
will be accompanied

1099
01:17:51,632 --> 01:17:53,467
by a sudden burst
of acceleration.

1100
01:17:55,636 --> 01:17:57,554
Hopefully, we'll hit
88 miles per hour

1101
01:17:57,638 --> 01:18:00,515
before the needle
gets much past 2,000.

1102
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,310
Why? What happens
after it hits 2,000?

1103
01:18:03,394 --> 01:18:05,187
The whole boiler
explodes!

1104
01:18:06,147 --> 01:18:07,230
Perfect!

1105
01:18:23,206 --> 01:18:25,082
Hey, Doc!
We just hit 35!

1106
01:18:25,166 --> 01:18:27,042
Okay, Marty.
I'm coming aboard!

1107
01:18:37,845 --> 01:18:41,598
Emmett!

1108
01:18:43,768 --> 01:18:45,352
Come on. Come on.

1109
01:18:54,904 --> 01:18:56,321
You better hold
onto something, Doc!

1110
01:18:56,405 --> 01:18:57,906
The yellow log
is about to blow!

1111
01:19:03,162 --> 01:19:04,204
Golly.

1112
01:19:07,875 --> 01:19:09,543
We just passed 40, Doc!

1113
01:19:32,108 --> 01:19:43,827
Emmett!

1114
01:19:46,247 --> 01:19:48,915
We just passed 45, Doc!
Go for it!

1115
01:19:59,302 --> 01:20:00,302
Fifty.

1116
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:12,480
Emmett!

1117
01:20:12,565 --> 01:20:13,565
Clara!

1118
01:20:14,567 --> 01:20:15,984
I love you!

1119
01:20:18,112 --> 01:20:20,405
Doc! Doc!
What's happening?

1120
01:20:20,489 --> 01:20:23,658
It's Clara!
She's on the train!

1121
01:20:24,243 --> 01:20:25,660
Clara? Perfect.

1122
01:20:26,287 --> 01:20:29,873
She's in the cab!
I'm going back for her!

1123
01:20:29,957 --> 01:20:31,041
The windmill!

1124
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:35,045
Doc! The windmill! We're going
past 50! You'll never make it!

1125
01:20:37,089 --> 01:20:38,924
Then we'll have to
take her back with us!

1126
01:20:39,008 --> 01:20:41,509
Keep calling out
the speed!

1127
01:20:41,594 --> 01:20:44,971
Clara,
climb out here to me!

1128
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:46,348
I don't know if I can!

1129
01:20:46,432 --> 01:20:47,891
You can do it!

1130
01:20:47,975 --> 01:20:50,101
Just don't look down!

1131
01:20:53,564 --> 01:20:54,814
That's it!

1132
01:21:08,996 --> 01:21:10,664
Sixty miles
an hour, Doc!

1133
01:21:13,793 --> 01:21:16,962
You're doing fine!
Nice and steady!

1134
01:21:20,341 --> 01:21:21,841
Come on!

1135
01:21:22,551 --> 01:21:24,636
Just a little further!

1136
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,680
I can't, Emmett!
I'm scared!

1137
01:21:29,183 --> 01:21:30,183
Seventy!

1138
01:21:31,185 --> 01:21:32,936
Keep coming, Clara!

1139
01:21:34,272 --> 01:21:37,315
Come on! Come on!
You're doing fine!

1140
01:21:38,526 --> 01:21:42,237
Come on!
Nice and easy!

1141
01:21:43,489 --> 01:21:46,324
Don't look down! That's
it! You're doing fine!

1142
01:21:49,245 --> 01:21:53,373
Doc! The red log
is about to blow!

1143
01:22:01,048 --> 01:22:02,048
Clara!

1144
01:22:04,885 --> 01:22:06,553
Emmett!

1145
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:18,106
I'm trying
to reach you!

1146
01:22:18,190 --> 01:22:19,441
Clara, hold on!

1147
01:22:19,525 --> 01:22:20,734
I can't!

1148
01:22:28,784 --> 01:22:29,826
Oh!

1149
01:22:30,953 --> 01:22:32,787
Doc, I'm gonna slip you
the Hoverboard!

1150
01:22:40,588 --> 01:22:42,088
Marty, watch out!

1151
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:52,098
Emmett, help!

1152
01:22:54,769 --> 01:22:56,353
Hold on, Clara!

1153
01:22:59,690 --> 01:23:01,274
Doc, ready, Doc?

1154
01:23:02,526 --> 01:23:03,568
Catch it!

1155
01:23:05,321 --> 01:23:06,571
Yes! Yes!

1156
01:23:17,249 --> 01:23:18,500
Emmett!

1157
01:23:18,584 --> 01:23:19,959
Hold on!

1158
01:23:23,631 --> 01:23:24,631
Yes!

1159
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:56,976
What is it? What is it, Pa?

1160
01:24:57,686 --> 01:25:00,980
Looks like an airplane without wings.

1161
01:25:01,523 --> 01:25:04,359
That ain't no airplane. Look.

1162
01:25:25,422 --> 01:25:26,672
Children!

1163
01:25:26,757 --> 01:25:28,091
Listen... Whoa.

1164
01:25:40,771 --> 01:25:41,979
Hello?

1165
01:25:45,109 --> 01:25:46,484
Excuse me.

1166
01:25:49,905 --> 01:25:51,155
Sorry about your barn.

1167
01:25:54,910 --> 01:25:58,204
It's already mutated
into human form! Shoot it!

1168
01:26:00,124 --> 01:26:02,458
Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!

1169
01:26:06,672 --> 01:26:07,839
Get away!

1170
01:26:09,091 --> 01:26:10,174
Hold it.

1171
01:26:10,551 --> 01:26:12,135
Shoot it, Pa!

1172
01:26:14,555 --> 01:26:17,598
My pine! Why you...

1173
01:26:19,643 --> 01:26:23,062
You space bastard! You killed our pine!

1174
01:26:27,443 --> 01:26:29,402
All right. All right. Okay, McFly.

1175
01:26:29,486 --> 01:26:31,612
Get a grip on yourself.
It's all a dream.

1176
01:26:31,697 --> 01:26:34,490
It's just a very intense dream.

1177
01:27:17,743 --> 01:27:18,993
Listen, you got to help me.

1178
01:27:19,077 --> 01:27:21,370
Don't stop, Wilbur! Don't!

1179
01:27:23,415 --> 01:27:24,415
It can't be.

1180
01:27:30,839 --> 01:27:31,839
This is nuts.

1181
01:27:36,595 --> 01:27:37,887
Come on.

1182
01:27:38,889 --> 01:27:40,181
Perfect.

1183
01:29:35,589 --> 01:29:39,133
Remember, fellow
citizens, the future is in your hands.

1184
01:29:39,217 --> 01:29:43,012
If you believe in progress,
re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.

1185
01:29:43,096 --> 01:29:45,139
Progress is his middle name.

1186
01:29:45,223 --> 01:29:47,808
Mayor Red Thomas' progress platform

1187
01:29:47,893 --> 01:29:50,436
means more jobs, better education,

1188
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:53,314
bigger civic improvements
and lower taxes.

1189
01:29:53,690 --> 01:29:57,401
On election day, cast your
vote for a proven leader.

1190
01:29:57,486 --> 01:29:59,820
Re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.

1191
01:30:03,116 --> 01:30:05,284
This has got to be a dream.

1192
01:30:22,135 --> 01:30:25,054
Hey, kid. What'd you do? Jump ship?

1193
01:30:25,138 --> 01:30:26,138
What?

1194
01:30:26,223 --> 01:30:27,890
What's with the life preserver?

1195
01:30:32,854 --> 01:30:35,147
I just want to use the phone.

1196
01:30:35,232 --> 01:30:36,440
Yeah, it's in the back.

1197
01:30:39,361 --> 01:30:40,695
Brown.

1198
01:30:43,073 --> 01:30:44,490
Great. You're alive.

1199
01:30:56,461 --> 01:30:57,795
Come on.

1200
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:07,096
Do you know where 1640 Riverside...

1201
01:31:07,180 --> 01:31:09,807
Are you going to order something, kid?

1202
01:31:11,435 --> 01:31:13,769
Yeah. Give me a Tab.

1203
01:31:14,646 --> 01:31:17,064
Tab? I can't give you a tab
unless you order something.

1204
01:31:17,149 --> 01:31:19,233
Right. Give me a Pepsi Free.

1205
01:31:19,317 --> 01:31:22,069
You want a Pepsi, pal,
you're going to pay for it.

1206
01:31:22,154 --> 01:31:25,364
Just give me something
without any sugar in it, okay?

1207
01:31:25,449 --> 01:31:27,450
Something without sugar.

1208
01:31:34,833 --> 01:31:36,292
Hey, McFly.

1209
01:31:38,712 --> 01:31:41,005
What do you think you're doing?

1210
01:31:41,298 --> 01:31:42,381
Biff.

1211
01:31:42,632 --> 01:31:45,134
I'm talking to you,
McFly, you Irish bug!

1212
01:31:45,218 --> 01:31:47,386
Hey, Biff. Hey, guys. How are you doing?

1213
01:31:47,471 --> 01:31:49,221
You got my homework finished, McFly?

1214
01:31:49,848 --> 01:31:52,558
Well, actually, I figured since
it wasn't due till Monday...

1215
01:31:52,642 --> 01:31:54,435
Hello? Hello? Anybody home?

1216
01:31:56,021 --> 01:31:57,897
Think, McFly. Think! Okay.

1217
01:31:57,981 --> 01:31:59,857
I got to have time to recopy it.

1218
01:31:59,941 --> 01:32:01,108
You realize what would happen

1219
01:32:01,193 --> 01:32:03,694
if I hand in my homework
in your handwriting?

1220
01:32:03,779 --> 01:32:05,488
I'll get kicked out of school.

1221
01:32:05,572 --> 01:32:08,032
You wouldn't want that
to happen, would you?

1222
01:32:09,910 --> 01:32:10,951
Would you?

1223
01:32:11,036 --> 01:32:12,077
Now, of course not, Biff.

1224
01:32:12,162 --> 01:32:14,079
No. I wouldn't want that to happen.

1225
01:32:14,164 --> 01:32:15,706
What are you looking at, butthead?

1226
01:32:15,791 --> 01:32:18,125
Biff, get a load of this
guy's life preserver.

1227
01:32:18,210 --> 01:32:19,919
Dork thinks he's going to drown.

1228
01:32:20,003 --> 01:32:22,296
How about my homework, McFly?

1229
01:32:23,006 --> 01:32:26,300
Okay, Biff. Well, I'll
finish that on up tonight

1230
01:32:26,384 --> 01:32:29,678
and then I'll bring it over
first thing tomorrow morning.

1231
01:32:29,763 --> 01:32:31,305
Not too early. I sleep in Sundays.

1232
01:32:31,389 --> 01:32:32,681
Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied!

1233
01:32:33,892 --> 01:32:35,935
Don't be so gullible, McFly. Okay.

1234
01:32:36,019 --> 01:32:37,102
I don't want to see you in here again.

1235
01:32:37,187 --> 01:32:39,897
Okay. All right. Bye-bye.

1236
01:33:01,711 --> 01:33:02,711
What?

1237
01:33:02,796 --> 01:33:04,088
You're George McFly.

1238
01:33:04,631 --> 01:33:06,006
Yeah. Who are you?

1239
01:33:06,091 --> 01:33:07,716
Say! Why do you let those boys

1240
01:33:07,801 --> 01:33:09,301
push you around like that for?

1241
01:33:09,386 --> 01:33:10,678
Well, they're bigger than me.

1242
01:33:10,762 --> 01:33:13,389
Stand tall, boy. Have
some respect for yourself.

1243
01:33:13,473 --> 01:33:15,683
Don't you know, if you let
people walk over you now,

1244
01:33:15,767 --> 01:33:17,852
they'll be walking over you
for the rest of your life.

1245
01:33:17,936 --> 01:33:19,353
Look at me. You think I'm gonna

1246
01:33:19,437 --> 01:33:21,105
spend the rest of my
life in this slop house?

1247
01:33:21,189 --> 01:33:22,982
Watch it, Goldie. No, sir!

1248
01:33:23,066 --> 01:33:24,275
I'm gonna make something of myself.

1249
01:33:24,359 --> 01:33:25,568
I'm going to night school,

1250
01:33:25,652 --> 01:33:27,862
and one day, I'm going to be somebody.

1251
01:33:27,946 --> 01:33:29,822
That's right. He's going to be mayor.

1252
01:33:29,906 --> 01:33:31,282
Yeah, I'm...

1253
01:33:31,950 --> 01:33:33,325
Mayor!

1254
01:33:34,077 --> 01:33:37,997
Now that's a good idea!
I could run for mayor.

1255
01:33:38,081 --> 01:33:39,582
A colored mayor. That'll be the day.

1256
01:33:39,666 --> 01:33:42,001
You wait and see, Mr.
Caruthers. I will be mayor.

1257
01:33:42,085 --> 01:33:44,378
I'll be the most powerful
man in Hill Valley,

1258
01:33:44,462 --> 01:33:46,255
and I'm going to clean up this town.

1259
01:33:46,339 --> 01:33:49,300
Good. You can start
by sweeping the floor.

1260
01:33:51,845 --> 01:33:55,973
Mayor Goldie Wilson. I
like the sound of that.

1261
01:34:08,486 --> 01:34:11,906
Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!

1262
01:34:43,188 --> 01:34:45,230
He's a peeping Tom.

1263
01:34:50,904 --> 01:34:51,946
Dad!

1264
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,794
Hey, wait a minute. Wait
a minute. Who are you?

1265
01:35:08,797 --> 01:35:11,632
Stella! Another one of these damn kids

1266
01:35:11,716 --> 01:35:13,092
jumped in front of my car!

1267
01:35:14,094 --> 01:35:17,262
Come on out here! Help
me take him in the house!

1268
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:24,770
Mom? That you?

1269
01:35:25,814 --> 01:35:28,857
There, there, now. Just relax.

1270
01:35:31,486 --> 01:35:34,530
You've been asleep for
almost nine hours now.

1271
01:35:36,366 --> 01:35:38,826
I had a horrible nightmare.

1272
01:35:39,869 --> 01:35:44,415
I dreamed that I went back
in time. It was terrible.

1273
01:35:45,667 --> 01:35:46,792
Well,

1274
01:35:47,419 --> 01:35:50,879
you're safe and sound
now, back in good old 1955.

1275
01:35:51,965 --> 01:35:53,382
1955?

1276
01:35:58,179 --> 01:36:00,973
You're my... You're my...

1277
01:36:01,057 --> 01:36:02,224
My name is Lorraine.

1278
01:36:03,685 --> 01:36:04,852
Lorraine Baines.

1279
01:36:04,936 --> 01:36:06,020
Yeah.

1280
01:36:07,147 --> 01:36:09,815
But you're... You're so...

1281
01:36:10,358 --> 01:36:13,402
You're so thin!

1282
01:36:13,778 --> 01:36:17,197
Just relax, Calvin. You got
a big bruise on your head.

1283
01:36:21,327 --> 01:36:23,328
Where are my pants?

1284
01:36:23,413 --> 01:36:26,498
Over there, on my hope chest.

1285
01:36:28,376 --> 01:36:31,003
I've never seen purple
underwear before, Calvin.

1286
01:36:31,796 --> 01:36:34,590
Calvin? Why do you
keep calling me Calvin?

1287
01:36:34,674 --> 01:36:37,593
Well, that is your name,
isn't it? Calvin Klein?

1288
01:36:38,136 --> 01:36:40,804
It's written all over your underwear.

1289
01:36:41,181 --> 01:36:43,599
Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh?

1290
01:36:43,933 --> 01:36:47,644
No, actually, people call me Marty.

1291
01:36:47,979 --> 01:36:49,104
Oh.

1292
01:36:49,731 --> 01:36:52,149
Pleased to meet you, Calvin.

1293
01:36:53,068 --> 01:36:54,443
Marty.

1294
01:36:55,862 --> 01:36:57,237
Klein.

1295
01:37:03,870 --> 01:37:05,913
Do you mind if I sit here?

1296
01:37:05,997 --> 01:37:07,206
No. Fine.

1297
01:37:07,290 --> 01:37:09,666
No. Good. Fine. Good.

1298
01:37:11,669 --> 01:37:13,879
That's a big bruise you have there.

1299
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:17,925
Lorraine, are you up there?

1300
01:37:18,009 --> 01:37:20,010
Oh, my God! It's my mother!

1301
01:37:20,095 --> 01:37:23,055
Quick! Put your pants back on!

1302
01:37:31,314 --> 01:37:34,108
So, tell me, Marty,
how long have you been in port?

1303
01:37:34,192 --> 01:37:35,192
Excuse me?

1304
01:37:35,276 --> 01:37:36,276
I guessed you're a sailor.

1305
01:37:36,361 --> 01:37:38,529
That's why you wear that life preserver.

1306
01:37:38,613 --> 01:37:40,114
Coast Guard.

1307
01:37:40,198 --> 01:37:42,116
Sam, here's the young man

1308
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:43,617
you hit with your car out there.

1309
01:37:43,701 --> 01:37:44,785
He's all right. Thank God.

1310
01:37:44,869 --> 01:37:47,079
What were you doing in the middle
of the street, a kid your age?

1311
01:37:47,163 --> 01:37:49,081
Don't pay attention to him.
He's in one of his moods.

1312
01:37:49,165 --> 01:37:50,749
Sam, you quit fiddling with that thing.

1313
01:37:50,834 --> 01:37:52,251
Come in here to dinner.

1314
01:37:52,335 --> 01:37:54,336
Now, let's see. You
already know Lorraine.

1315
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:58,257
This is Milton, this
is Sally, that's Toby,

1316
01:37:58,341 --> 01:38:01,552
and over there in the
playpen is little baby Joey.

1317
01:38:03,221 --> 01:38:05,222
So, you're my uncle Joey.

1318
01:38:06,099 --> 01:38:08,475
Better get used to these bars, kid.

1319
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:12,688
Yes. Joey just loves
being in his playpen.

1320
01:38:13,148 --> 01:38:14,481
He cries whenever we take him out,

1321
01:38:14,566 --> 01:38:16,567
so we just leave him
in there all the time.

1322
01:38:16,651 --> 01:38:18,861
Well, Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.

1323
01:38:18,945 --> 01:38:21,155
Listen, I really ought to...

1324
01:38:21,239 --> 01:38:22,447
Sit here, Marty.

1325
01:38:23,032 --> 01:38:24,908
Sam, stop fiddling with that thing

1326
01:38:24,993 --> 01:38:27,452
and come in here and eat your dinner.

1327
01:38:29,247 --> 01:38:30,998
Look at it roll.

1328
01:38:31,082 --> 01:38:33,125
Now we can watch Jackie
Gleason while we eat.

1329
01:38:42,093 --> 01:38:43,886
It's our first television set.

1330
01:38:43,970 --> 01:38:45,596
Dad just picked it up today.

1331
01:38:46,472 --> 01:38:48,557
Do you have a television?

1332
01:38:48,641 --> 01:38:51,518
Well, yeah. You know
we have two of them.

1333
01:38:51,603 --> 01:38:54,396
Wow! You must be rich.

1334
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:56,023
Oh, honey, he's teasing you.

1335
01:38:56,107 --> 01:38:58,567
Nobody has two television sets.

1336
01:39:03,615 --> 01:39:05,908
Hey. Hey, I've seen this one.

1337
01:39:05,992 --> 01:39:07,409
I've seen this one! This is a classic.

1338
01:39:07,493 --> 01:39:10,787
This is where Ralph dresses
up as a man from space.

1339
01:39:10,872 --> 01:39:14,291
What do you mean, you've
seen this? It's brand-new.

1340
01:39:14,375 --> 01:39:16,710
Yeah, well, I saw it on a rerun.

1341
01:39:17,462 --> 01:39:19,254
What's a rerun?

1342
01:39:19,339 --> 01:39:20,464
You'll find out.

1343
01:39:20,965 --> 01:39:25,135
You know, Marty, you look so
familiar to me. Do I know your mother?

1344
01:39:26,554 --> 01:39:28,597
Yeah, I think maybe you do.

1345
01:39:28,681 --> 01:39:30,265
Oh, then I
want to give her a call.

1346
01:39:30,350 --> 01:39:32,017
I don't want her to worry about you.

1347
01:39:32,101 --> 01:39:33,477
You can't.

1348
01:39:34,354 --> 01:39:37,648
That is, nobody's home.

1349
01:39:38,942 --> 01:39:40,025
Oh.

1350
01:39:40,401 --> 01:39:41,526
Yet.

1351
01:39:42,070 --> 01:39:43,153
Oh.

1352
01:39:43,780 --> 01:39:47,658
Listen, do you know
where Riverside Drive is?

1353
01:39:47,742 --> 01:39:49,243
It's on the other end of town.

1354
01:39:49,327 --> 01:39:51,870
A block past Maple. East end of town.

1355
01:39:51,955 --> 01:39:53,330
Wait a minute, a block past Maple.

1356
01:39:53,414 --> 01:39:55,916
That's John F. Kennedy Drive.

1357
01:39:56,793 --> 01:39:58,794
Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?

1358
01:39:58,878 --> 01:40:00,170
Mother?

1359
01:40:00,797 --> 01:40:03,423
With Marty's parents out of town,

1360
01:40:03,967 --> 01:40:06,385
don't you think he
ought to spend the night?

1361
01:40:06,469 --> 01:40:08,887
I mean, after all, Dad almost
killed him with the car.

1362
01:40:09,097 --> 01:40:11,056
That's true, Marty.

1363
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:12,766
I think maybe you
should spend the night.

1364
01:40:12,850 --> 01:40:14,393
I think you're our responsibility.

1365
01:40:14,477 --> 01:40:16,103
Gee, I don't know.

1366
01:40:16,187 --> 01:40:17,938
And he can sleep in my room.

1367
01:40:18,648 --> 01:40:20,607
I gotta go! I gotta go!

1368
01:40:20,692 --> 01:40:22,109
Thanks very much. It was wonderful.

1369
01:40:22,193 --> 01:40:26,530
You were all great. See
you all later. Much later.

1370
01:40:30,994 --> 01:40:33,787
He's a very strange young man.

1371
01:40:33,871 --> 01:40:34,997
He's an idiot.

1372
01:40:35,331 --> 01:40:39,042
Comes from upbringing. His
parents are probably idiots, too.

1373
01:40:39,419 --> 01:40:40,627
Lorraine, you ever have a kid

1374
01:40:40,712 --> 01:40:43,005
who acts that way, I'll disown you.

1375
01:41:21,085 --> 01:41:22,169
Doc?

1376
01:41:23,087 --> 01:41:24,629
Don't say a word.

1377
01:41:25,923 --> 01:41:27,007
I don't wanna know your name.

1378
01:41:27,091 --> 01:41:28,258
I don't want to know anything about you.

1379
01:41:28,343 --> 01:41:30,093
Listen, Doc... Quiet!

1380
01:41:30,178 --> 01:41:31,678
Doc, it's me, Marty.
Don't tell me anything.

1381
01:41:31,763 --> 01:41:33,930
Doc, you got to help... Quiet. Quiet.

1382
01:41:36,684 --> 01:41:38,685
I'm going to read your thoughts.

1383
01:41:38,770 --> 01:41:42,356
Let's see now. You've come
here from a great distance?

1384
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:43,565
Yeah. Exactly.

1385
01:41:43,649 --> 01:41:44,775
Don't tell me!

1386
01:41:45,443 --> 01:41:46,860
You want me to buy a subscription

1387
01:41:46,944 --> 01:41:48,278
to the Saturday Evening Post.

1388
01:41:48,363 --> 01:41:49,404
No.

1389
01:41:49,489 --> 01:41:50,947
Not a word. Not a word now!

1390
01:41:51,032 --> 01:41:52,199
Quiet.

1391
01:41:54,369 --> 01:41:57,954
Donations. You want
me to make a donation

1392
01:41:58,039 --> 01:42:00,290
to the Coast Guard Youth Auxiliary.

1393
01:42:00,875 --> 01:42:02,292
Doc.

1394
01:42:03,795 --> 01:42:04,836
I'm from the future.

1395
01:42:06,005 --> 01:42:09,132
I came here in a time
machine that you invented.

1396
01:42:09,509 --> 01:42:14,304
Now, I need your help to
get back to the year 1985.

1397
01:42:15,681 --> 01:42:17,265
My God.

1398
01:42:21,687 --> 01:42:23,897
Do you know what this means?

1399
01:42:25,566 --> 01:42:29,903
It means that this damn
thing doesn't work at all!

1400
01:42:29,987 --> 01:42:31,905
Doc, you got to help
me. You are the only one

1401
01:42:31,989 --> 01:42:34,324
who knows how your time machine works.

1402
01:42:34,409 --> 01:42:38,245
Time machine? I haven't
invented any time machine.

1403
01:42:40,164 --> 01:42:42,582
Okay. All right, I'll prove it to you.

1404
01:42:42,667 --> 01:42:45,836
Look at my driver's
license. Expires 1987.

1405
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:47,421
Look at my birthday,
for crying out loud!

1406
01:42:47,505 --> 01:42:49,506
I haven't even been born yet.

1407
01:42:49,590 --> 01:42:51,925
And look at this picture.

1408
01:42:52,009 --> 01:42:54,010
It's my brother, my sister and me.

1409
01:42:54,095 --> 01:42:57,389
Look at her sweatshirt,
Doc. "Class of 1984"?

1410
01:42:58,349 --> 01:43:00,350
Pretty mediocre photographic fakery.

1411
01:43:00,435 --> 01:43:02,686
They cut off your brother's hair.

1412
01:43:03,229 --> 01:43:05,605
I'm telling the truth,
Doc. You got to believe me.

1413
01:43:05,690 --> 01:43:07,774
Then tell me, future boy,

1414
01:43:08,943 --> 01:43:12,696
Who's President of the
United States in 1985?

1415
01:43:13,114 --> 01:43:14,156
Ronald Reagan.

1416
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:16,616
Ronald Reagan? The actor?

1417
01:43:18,202 --> 01:43:20,745
Then who's vice president? Jerry Lewis?

1418
01:43:21,914 --> 01:43:24,291
I suppose Jane Wyman is the First Lady.

1419
01:43:24,375 --> 01:43:25,459
Whoa. Wait, Doc!

1420
01:43:25,543 --> 01:43:27,752
And Jack Benny is
secretary of the treasury.

1421
01:43:27,837 --> 01:43:29,254
Doc, you gotta listen to me.

1422
01:43:29,338 --> 01:43:31,423
I've had enough practical
jokes for one evening.

1423
01:43:31,507 --> 01:43:32,674
Good night, future boy!

1424
01:43:32,758 --> 01:43:34,134
No, wait, Doc. Doc.

1425
01:43:34,218 --> 01:43:37,012
The bruise on your head,
I know how that happened.

1426
01:43:37,096 --> 01:43:38,513
You told me the whole story.

1427
01:43:38,598 --> 01:43:40,056
You were standing on your toilet

1428
01:43:40,141 --> 01:43:41,183
and you were hanging a clock,

1429
01:43:41,267 --> 01:43:43,477
and you fell and you hit
your head on the sink.

1430
01:43:43,561 --> 01:43:46,480
That's when you came up with
the idea for the flux capacitor,

1431
01:43:46,564 --> 01:43:50,567
which is what makes
time travel possible.

1432
01:44:03,664 --> 01:44:07,834
There's something wrong with
the starter, so I hid it here.

1433
01:44:18,346 --> 01:44:22,182
After I fell off my toilet, I drew this.

1434
01:44:26,687 --> 01:44:28,480
The flux capacitor.

1435
01:44:46,332 --> 01:44:47,624
It works!

1436
01:44:50,169 --> 01:44:51,711
It works!

1437
01:44:53,005 --> 01:44:55,715
I finally invent something that works!

1438
01:44:56,467 --> 01:44:58,593
You bet your ass it works.

1439
01:44:59,512 --> 01:45:02,556
Somehow we've got to sneak
this back to my laboratory.

1440
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:04,558
We've got to get you home!

1441
01:45:05,226 --> 01:45:07,018
Okay, Doc, this is it.

1442
01:45:08,813 --> 01:45:10,897
Never mind that. Never mind that now.

1443
01:45:10,982 --> 01:45:14,401
Why, that's me! Look
at me! I'm an old man.

1444
01:45:14,485 --> 01:45:15,735
Good evening. I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.

1445
01:45:15,820 --> 01:45:17,904
I'm standing on the parking
lot at Twin Pines Mall.

1446
01:45:17,989 --> 01:45:19,990
Thank God, I've still got my hair.

1447
01:45:20,074 --> 01:45:22,075
What's on Earth is
this thing I'm wearing?

1448
01:45:22,159 --> 01:45:24,327
This is a radiation suit.

1449
01:45:24,412 --> 01:45:26,162
Radiation suit?

1450
01:45:26,247 --> 01:45:29,249
Of course. 'Cause of all the
fallout from the atomic wars.

1451
01:45:30,585 --> 01:45:33,253
This is truly amazing.

1452
01:45:33,754 --> 01:45:36,590
A portable television studio.

1453
01:45:36,674 --> 01:45:38,174
No wonder your president
has to be an actor.

1454
01:45:38,259 --> 01:45:40,427
He's gotta look good on television.

1455
01:45:40,511 --> 01:45:42,929
Whoa. This is it. This is
the part coming up, Doc.

1456
01:45:43,681 --> 01:45:45,140
No, no, no, this sucker's electrical,

1457
01:45:45,224 --> 01:45:46,266
but I need a nuclear reaction

1458
01:45:46,350 --> 01:45:48,143
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts...

1459
01:45:48,227 --> 01:45:50,020
What did I just say?

1460
01:45:54,025 --> 01:45:55,108
This sucker's electrical,

1461
01:45:55,192 --> 01:45:56,318
but I need a nuclear reaction

1462
01:45:56,402 --> 01:45:58,111
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts...

1463
01:45:58,195 --> 01:46:00,530
1.21 gigawatts!

1464
01:46:02,033 --> 01:46:04,242
1.21 gigawatts.

1465
01:46:06,245 --> 01:46:07,871
Great Scott!

1466
01:46:10,041 --> 01:46:12,250
What the hell is a gigawatt?

1467
01:46:13,252 --> 01:46:17,339
How could I have been so
careless? 1.21 gigawatts!

1468
01:46:17,423 --> 01:46:20,133
Tom, how am I going to
generate that kind of power?

1469
01:46:20,217 --> 01:46:21,843
It can't be done, can it?

1470
01:46:21,927 --> 01:46:24,679
Doc, look. All we need
is a little plutonium.

1471
01:46:25,890 --> 01:46:27,641
I'm sure that in 1985,

1472
01:46:27,725 --> 01:46:29,893
plutonium is available
in every corner drugstore,

1473
01:46:29,977 --> 01:46:32,729
but in 1955, it's a
little hard to come by.

1474
01:46:32,813 --> 01:46:36,149
Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm
afraid you're stuck here.

1475
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:37,400
Whoa, whoa.

1476
01:46:37,485 --> 01:46:41,905
Doc, stuck here? I can't be
stuck here. I got a life in 1985.

1477
01:46:41,989 --> 01:46:43,073
I got a girl.

1478
01:46:43,157 --> 01:46:44,199
Is she pretty?

1479
01:46:44,742 --> 01:46:48,703
Doc, she's beautiful.
She's crazy about me.

1480
01:46:48,788 --> 01:46:53,083
Look at this. Look what she wrote
here, Doc. I mean, that says it all.

1481
01:46:54,335 --> 01:46:56,920
Doc, you're my only hope.

1482
01:46:57,588 --> 01:47:00,924
Marty, I'm sorry, but the only
power source capable of generating

1483
01:47:01,008 --> 01:47:04,427
1.21 gigawatts of electricity
is a bolt of lightning.

1484
01:47:05,638 --> 01:47:06,763
What did you say?

1485
01:47:06,847 --> 01:47:08,014
A bolt of lightning.

1486
01:47:08,099 --> 01:47:09,099
Unfortunately, you never know

1487
01:47:09,183 --> 01:47:12,310
when or where it's ever going to strike.

1488
01:47:13,813 --> 01:47:15,188
We do now.

1489
01:47:20,277 --> 01:47:23,863
This is it! This is the answer.

1490
01:47:24,615 --> 01:47:27,033
It says here that a bolt of lightning

1491
01:47:27,118 --> 01:47:28,118
is going to strike the clock tower

1492
01:47:28,202 --> 01:47:31,454
at precisely 10:04 p.m.
Next Saturday night!

1493
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:38,461
If we could somehow
harness this lightning,

1494
01:47:39,630 --> 01:47:42,882
channel it into the flux capacitor,

1495
01:47:44,176 --> 01:47:45,969
it just might work.

1496
01:47:46,262 --> 01:47:50,515
Next Saturday night, we're
sending you back to the future!

1497
01:47:51,475 --> 01:47:53,351
Okay, all right. Saturday's
good. Saturday's good.

1498
01:47:53,436 --> 01:47:55,228
I can spend a week in 1955.

1499
01:47:55,312 --> 01:47:57,063
I can hang out. You can show me around.

1500
01:47:57,148 --> 01:47:58,982
Marty, that is completely
out of the question.

1501
01:47:59,066 --> 01:48:00,400
You must not leave this house.

1502
01:48:00,484 --> 01:48:02,485
You must not see anybody
or talk to anybody.

1503
01:48:02,570 --> 01:48:05,155
Anything you do can have serious
repercussions on future events.

1504
01:48:05,239 --> 01:48:06,990
Do you understand?

1505
01:48:07,867 --> 01:48:09,826
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

1506
01:48:10,453 --> 01:48:11,661
Marty,

1507
01:48:12,079 --> 01:48:15,540
have you interacted with
anybody else today, besides me?

1508
01:48:17,334 --> 01:48:20,462
Yeah, well, I might've sort
of bumped into my parents.

1509
01:48:20,546 --> 01:48:22,088
Great Scott!

1510
01:48:22,173 --> 01:48:24,466
Let me see that photograph
again of your brother.

1511
01:48:27,845 --> 01:48:31,264
Just as I thought. This proves
my theory. Look at your brother.

1512
01:48:32,516 --> 01:48:35,727
His head's gone.
It's like it's been erased.

1513
01:48:37,396 --> 01:48:39,439
Erased from existence.

1514
01:48:44,028 --> 01:48:45,111
Whoa.

1515
01:48:45,196 --> 01:48:47,947
They really cleaned this
place up. Looks brand-new.

1516
01:48:48,032 --> 01:48:49,032
Now remember.

1517
01:48:49,116 --> 01:48:50,366
According to my theory, you interfered

1518
01:48:50,451 --> 01:48:51,618
with your parents' first meeting.

1519
01:48:51,702 --> 01:48:52,952
If they don't meet,
they won't fall in love,

1520
01:48:53,037 --> 01:48:54,829
they won't get married
and they won't have kids.

1521
01:48:54,914 --> 01:48:55,955
That's why your older brother's

1522
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:57,290
disappearing from that photograph.

1523
01:48:57,374 --> 01:48:59,584
Your sister will follow, and
unless you repair the damage,

1524
01:48:59,668 --> 01:49:00,877
you'll be next.

1525
01:49:00,961 --> 01:49:02,796
Sounds pretty heavy.
Weight has nothing to do with it.

1526
01:49:04,006 --> 01:49:05,882
Which one's your pop?

1527
01:49:07,051 --> 01:49:08,384
That's him.

1528
01:49:08,844 --> 01:49:11,262
Okay. Okay, you guys.

1529
01:49:12,890 --> 01:49:16,142
Very funny. You guys
are being real mature.

1530
01:49:16,227 --> 01:49:18,102
Maybe you were adopted.

1531
01:49:18,187 --> 01:49:20,730
Okay, real mature, guys.

1532
01:49:21,649 --> 01:49:23,024
Okay, pick up my books.

1533
01:49:23,108 --> 01:49:24,150
McFly.

1534
01:49:24,235 --> 01:49:25,944
That's Strickland.

1535
01:49:26,403 --> 01:49:28,488
Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?

1536
01:49:28,572 --> 01:49:31,324
Shape up, man. You're a slacker.

1537
01:49:31,408 --> 01:49:34,494
Do you want to be a slacker
for the rest of your life?

1538
01:49:34,578 --> 01:49:35,620
No.

1539
01:49:35,996 --> 01:49:37,539
What did your mother
ever see in that kid?

1540
01:49:37,623 --> 01:49:38,915
I don't know, Doc.

1541
01:49:38,999 --> 01:49:40,708
I guess she felt sorry for him

1542
01:49:40,793 --> 01:49:43,127
'cause her dad hit him with the car.

1543
01:49:43,420 --> 01:49:45,672
Hit me with the car.

1544
01:49:45,756 --> 01:49:47,757
That's the Florence Nightingale effect.

1545
01:49:47,842 --> 01:49:51,177
It happens in hospitals when nurses
fall in love with their patients.

1546
01:49:51,262 --> 01:49:52,512
Go to it, kid.

1547
01:49:53,347 --> 01:49:56,182
Hey, George, buddy.

1548
01:49:56,767 --> 01:49:59,143
I have been looking all over for you.

1549
01:49:59,228 --> 01:50:02,188
You remember me, the guy who
saved your life the other day?

1550
01:50:02,273 --> 01:50:03,356
Oh.

1551
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:04,440
Yeah. Good.

1552
01:50:04,525 --> 01:50:06,526
There's somebody I'd like you to meet.

1553
01:50:10,948 --> 01:50:12,532
Lorraine?

1554
01:50:12,616 --> 01:50:13,741
Calvin!

1555
01:50:15,202 --> 01:50:17,954
I'd like you to meet my
good friend George McFly.

1556
01:50:18,038 --> 01:50:21,291
Hi. It's really a pleasure to meet you.

1557
01:50:22,459 --> 01:50:23,501
How's your head?

1558
01:50:23,586 --> 01:50:24,919
Good. Fine.

1559
01:50:25,004 --> 01:50:26,880
Oh. I've been so worried about you

1560
01:50:26,964 --> 01:50:28,840
ever since you ran off the other night.

1561
01:50:28,924 --> 01:50:30,383
Are you okay? Yeah.

1562
01:50:31,635 --> 01:50:32,886
I'm sorry. I have to go.

1563
01:50:32,970 --> 01:50:34,220
Come on!

1564
01:50:35,055 --> 01:50:36,890
Isn't he a dreamboat?

1565
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:42,604
Doc, she didn't even look at him.

1566
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:44,230
This is more serious than I thought.

1567
01:50:44,315 --> 01:50:46,274
Apparently, your mother is
amorously infatuated with you,

1568
01:50:46,358 --> 01:50:47,984
instead of your father.

1569
01:50:48,611 --> 01:50:49,736
Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc.

1570
01:50:49,820 --> 01:50:53,489
Are you trying to tell me that
my mother has got the hots for me?

1571
01:50:53,574 --> 01:50:54,699
Precisely.

1572
01:50:54,783 --> 01:50:55,825
Whoa. This is heavy.

1573
01:50:56,410 --> 01:50:58,494
There's that word again. "Heavy."

1574
01:50:58,579 --> 01:50:59,913
Why are things so heavy in the future?

1575
01:50:59,997 --> 01:51:02,081
Is there a problem with the
Earth's gravitational pull?

1576
01:51:02,166 --> 01:51:03,249
What? The only way

1577
01:51:03,334 --> 01:51:04,751
we're going to get those
two to successfully mate

1578
01:51:04,835 --> 01:51:06,210
is if they're alone together,

1579
01:51:06,295 --> 01:51:08,922
so you've got to get your
father and mother to interact

1580
01:51:09,006 --> 01:51:11,090
in some sort of social...

1581
01:51:12,426 --> 01:51:13,968
What? You mean like a date? Right!

1582
01:51:15,179 --> 01:51:16,262
What kind of date? I don't know.

1583
01:51:16,347 --> 01:51:17,889
What do kids do in the '50s?

1584
01:51:17,973 --> 01:51:20,767
They're your parents.
You must know them.

1585
01:51:20,851 --> 01:51:21,976
What are their common interests?

1586
01:51:22,061 --> 01:51:24,020
What do they like to do together?

1587
01:51:25,022 --> 01:51:26,105
Nothing.

1588
01:51:26,190 --> 01:51:29,400
Look! There's a rhythmic
ceremonial ritual coming up.

1589
01:51:29,485 --> 01:51:31,444
Of course! The Enchantment
Under the Sea dance!

1590
01:51:31,528 --> 01:51:32,904
They're supposed to go to this.

1591
01:51:32,988 --> 01:51:34,739
That's where they kiss
for the first time.

1592
01:51:34,823 --> 01:51:36,199
All right, kid.

1593
01:51:36,283 --> 01:51:37,867
You stick to your father like glue

1594
01:51:37,952 --> 01:51:39,494
and make sure he takes
her to that dance.

1595
01:51:40,204 --> 01:51:41,704
George, buddy.

1596
01:51:42,539 --> 01:51:45,792
Remember that girl I
introduced you to, Lorraine?

1597
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:53,466
What are you writing?

1598
01:51:53,550 --> 01:51:55,551
Uh... Stories.

1599
01:51:56,387 --> 01:51:59,931
Science fiction stories about visitors

1600
01:52:00,391 --> 01:52:03,643
coming down to Earth from other planets.

1601
01:52:05,688 --> 01:52:09,357
Get out of town! I didn't
know you did anything creative.

1602
01:52:09,858 --> 01:52:10,984
Let me read some.

1603
01:52:11,068 --> 01:52:12,652
Oh. No, no, no, no.

1604
01:52:12,736 --> 01:52:15,571
I never let anybody read my stories.

1605
01:52:16,323 --> 01:52:17,573
Why not?

1606
01:52:17,992 --> 01:52:19,867
Well, what if they didn't like them?

1607
01:52:19,952 --> 01:52:22,412
What if they told me I was no good?

1608
01:52:24,498 --> 01:52:27,333
I guess that would be pretty
hard for somebody to understand.

1609
01:52:28,752 --> 01:52:31,337
No. No, not hard at all.

1610
01:52:32,548 --> 01:52:35,091
So, anyway, George. About Lorraine.

1611
01:52:36,260 --> 01:52:38,094
She really likes you.

1612
01:52:39,054 --> 01:52:42,015
She told me to tell you
that she wants you to ask her

1613
01:52:42,099 --> 01:52:43,850
to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance.

1614
01:52:43,934 --> 01:52:45,101
Really? Oh, yeah.

1615
01:52:45,185 --> 01:52:48,271
All you got to do is go
over there and ask her.

1616
01:52:49,189 --> 01:52:51,357
What? Right here, right
now, in the cafeteria?

1617
01:52:51,442 --> 01:52:52,525
What if she said no?

1618
01:52:52,609 --> 01:52:56,070
I don't know if I could take
that kind of a rejection.

1619
01:52:56,864 --> 01:53:00,783
Besides, I think she'd
rather go with somebody else.

1620
01:53:02,119 --> 01:53:03,286
Who?

1621
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:06,205
Biff.

1622
01:53:07,750 --> 01:53:08,875
Don't kid around. Come on.

1623
01:53:08,959 --> 01:53:10,209
I'm gonna leave.

1624
01:53:10,294 --> 01:53:12,170
You want it. You know you want it.

1625
01:53:12,254 --> 01:53:14,380
You know you want me to give it to you.

1626
01:53:14,465 --> 01:53:17,050
Shut your filthy mouth.
I'm not that kind of girl.

1627
01:53:18,302 --> 01:53:21,054
Maybe you are and you
just don't know it yet.

1628
01:53:21,138 --> 01:53:22,972
Get your meat hooks off of me.

1629
01:53:23,057 --> 01:53:24,098
You heard her.

1630
01:53:24,183 --> 01:53:27,560
She said, get your meat hooks off.

1631
01:53:28,979 --> 01:53:30,229
Please.

1632
01:53:31,065 --> 01:53:33,149
So what's it to you, butthead?

1633
01:53:34,276 --> 01:53:36,527
You know, you been looking for a fight.

1634
01:53:46,455 --> 01:53:50,500
Since you're new here, I'm
going to cut you a break, today.

1635
01:53:52,336 --> 01:53:56,089
So, why don't you make like
a tree and get out of here.

1636
01:54:08,811 --> 01:54:10,019
George!

1637
01:54:11,355 --> 01:54:13,397
Why do you keep following me around?

1638
01:54:13,482 --> 01:54:16,442
Look, George... I'm telling you, George,

1639
01:54:16,527 --> 01:54:18,277
if you do not ask
Lorraine to that dance,

1640
01:54:18,362 --> 01:54:19,862
I'm gonna regret it
for the rest of my life.

1641
01:54:19,947 --> 01:54:21,405
But I can't go to the dance.

1642
01:54:21,490 --> 01:54:24,617
I'll miss my favorite television
program, Science Fiction Theatre.

1643
01:54:24,701 --> 01:54:28,079
Yeah, but, George, Lorraine
wants to go with you.

1644
01:54:28,163 --> 01:54:29,288
Give her a break.

1645
01:54:29,373 --> 01:54:33,543
Look, I'm just not ready to
ask Lorraine out to the dance,

1646
01:54:34,336 --> 01:54:37,547
and not you or anybody
else on this planet

1647
01:54:37,631 --> 01:54:40,216
is going to make me change my mind.

1648
01:54:47,015 --> 01:54:49,016
Science Fiction Theatre.

1649
01:55:20,591 --> 01:55:21,632
Who are you?

1650
01:55:27,222 --> 01:55:29,265
Silence, Earthling.

1651
01:55:30,726 --> 01:55:33,186
My name is Darth Vader.

1652
01:55:38,233 --> 01:55:41,694
I am an extraterrestrial
from the planet Vulcan.

1653
01:55:43,780 --> 01:55:44,947
Marty!

1654
01:55:48,118 --> 01:55:49,202
Marty! Marty!

1655
01:55:49,286 --> 01:55:50,369
Hey, George, buddy.

1656
01:55:50,454 --> 01:55:52,830
You weren't at school. What
have you been doing all day?

1657
01:55:52,915 --> 01:55:55,833
I overslept. Look, I need your help.

1658
01:55:55,918 --> 01:55:57,376
I have to ask Lorraine out,

1659
01:55:57,461 --> 01:55:58,544
but I don't know how to do it.

1660
01:55:58,629 --> 01:56:01,464
All right. Okay, listen, keep your
pants on. She's over in the cafe.

1661
01:56:01,548 --> 01:56:03,591
God! How do you...

1662
01:56:06,678 --> 01:56:08,137
What made you change your mind, George?

1663
01:56:08,222 --> 01:56:11,140
Last night, Darth Vader
came down from Planet Vulcan

1664
01:56:11,225 --> 01:56:15,144
and told me that if I didn't take
Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.

1665
01:56:15,229 --> 01:56:18,314
Let's just keep this brain-melting
stuff to ourselves, okay?

1666
01:56:18,398 --> 01:56:19,523
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1667
01:56:19,608 --> 01:56:21,901
All right, okay. There she is, George.

1668
01:56:21,985 --> 01:56:23,736
Now just go in there and invite her.

1669
01:56:23,820 --> 01:56:25,404
Okay. But I don't know what to say.

1670
01:56:25,489 --> 01:56:26,572
Just say anything, George.

1671
01:56:26,657 --> 01:56:30,701
Say whatever's natural, the first
thing that comes into your mind.

1672
01:56:31,328 --> 01:56:33,246
Nothing's coming to my mind.

1673
01:56:33,330 --> 01:56:35,039
Jesus, George, it's a
wonder I was even born.

1674
01:56:35,123 --> 01:56:36,082
What? What?

1675
01:56:36,166 --> 01:56:37,667
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

1676
01:56:38,252 --> 01:56:42,338
Look, tell her destiny
brought you together.

1677
01:56:42,422 --> 01:56:44,340
Tell her that she is
the most beautiful girl

1678
01:56:44,424 --> 01:56:46,259
you have ever seen in the world.

1679
01:56:46,343 --> 01:56:48,302
Girls like that stuff.

1680
01:56:48,679 --> 01:56:49,679
What are you doing, George?

1681
01:56:49,763 --> 01:56:51,555
I'm writing this down.
This is good stuff.

1682
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:53,140
Yeah. Okay, let's go.

1683
01:56:53,225 --> 01:56:54,684
Can you take care of that? Right.

1684
01:57:13,203 --> 01:57:16,122
Lou, give me a milk.

1685
01:57:17,499 --> 01:57:18,874
Chocolate.

1686
01:57:35,058 --> 01:57:40,146
Lorraine. My density
has popped me to you.

1687
01:57:41,523 --> 01:57:42,732
What?

1688
01:57:42,899 --> 01:57:43,983
Oh.

1689
01:57:44,818 --> 01:57:47,486
What I meant to say was...

1690
01:57:47,571 --> 01:57:50,656
Wait a minute. Don't I
know you from somewhere?

1691
01:57:51,074 --> 01:57:52,199
Yes.

1692
01:57:52,492 --> 01:57:56,412
Yes. I'm George. George McFly.

1693
01:57:57,039 --> 01:57:58,706
I'm your density.

1694
01:57:59,708 --> 01:58:01,000
I mean,

1695
01:58:02,419 --> 01:58:03,836
your destiny.

1696
01:58:05,047 --> 01:58:06,130
Oh.

1697
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:08,257
Hey, McFly.

1698
01:58:12,679 --> 01:58:15,598
I thought I told you
never to come in here.

1699
01:58:18,101 --> 01:58:20,311
Well, it's going to cost you.

1700
01:58:20,687 --> 01:58:22,938
How much money you got on you?

1701
01:58:23,273 --> 01:58:25,399
How much do you want, Biff?

1702
01:58:33,617 --> 01:58:35,201
All right, punk.

1703
01:58:35,285 --> 01:58:36,285
Now I'm going to...

1704
01:58:36,370 --> 01:58:38,037
Whoa, whoa, Biff. What's that?

1705
01:58:44,753 --> 01:58:47,797
That's Calvin Klein.
Oh, my God, he's a dream.

1706
01:58:47,964 --> 01:58:49,006
Whoa, whoa.

1707
01:58:49,091 --> 01:58:50,883
Kid! Kid, stop! Stop!

1708
01:58:50,967 --> 01:58:52,134
Hey!

1709
01:58:54,304 --> 01:58:55,388
I'll get it
back to you, all right?

1710
01:58:56,431 --> 01:58:58,140
You broke it!

1711
01:58:58,475 --> 01:58:59,558
Come back here!

1712
01:59:01,770 --> 01:59:03,521
Wow. Look at him go!

1713
01:59:05,399 --> 01:59:06,649
Get him!

1714
01:59:19,996 --> 01:59:22,164
To the car! Go! Go!

1715
01:59:28,463 --> 01:59:29,713
What's that thing he's on?

1716
01:59:29,798 --> 01:59:31,257
It's a board with wheels.

1717
01:59:31,341 --> 01:59:32,925
He's an absolute dream.

1718
01:59:33,009 --> 01:59:34,218
Come on, come on!

1719
01:59:34,302 --> 01:59:35,845
Look out for the car!

1720
01:59:51,611 --> 01:59:52,862
Whoa!

1721
02:00:09,171 --> 02:00:11,005
I'm going to ram him.

1722
02:00:18,388 --> 02:00:19,555
Shit!

1723
02:00:31,109 --> 02:00:32,234
Ooh!

1724
02:00:44,789 --> 02:00:46,499
Thanks a lot, kid.

1725
02:00:47,626 --> 02:00:50,044
I'm going to get that son of a bitch.

1726
02:00:50,128 --> 02:00:51,170
Where does he come from?

1727
02:00:51,254 --> 02:00:53,130
Yeah, where does he live?

1728
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:57,426
I don't know, but I'm going to find out.

1729
02:01:03,266 --> 02:01:04,600
Oh, my God.

1730
02:01:05,018 --> 02:01:08,103
They found me. I don't
know how, but they found me.

1731
02:01:08,188 --> 02:01:09,855
Run for it, Marty!

1732
02:01:14,569 --> 02:01:15,945
Oh, my God.

1733
02:01:16,738 --> 02:01:19,657
They found me. I don't
know how, but they found me.

1734
02:01:19,741 --> 02:01:21,116
Run for it, Marty!

1735
02:01:22,410 --> 02:01:23,494
Doc?

1736
02:01:24,246 --> 02:01:27,206
Hi, Marty. I didn't hear you come in.

1737
02:01:28,166 --> 02:01:30,709
Fascinating device, this video unit.

1738
02:01:31,711 --> 02:01:33,379
Listen, Doc.

1739
02:01:33,463 --> 02:01:34,421
You know, there's something

1740
02:01:34,506 --> 02:01:35,673
I haven't told you about the night

1741
02:01:35,799 --> 02:01:37,091
we made that tape. Please,
Marty, don't tell me.

1742
02:01:37,175 --> 02:01:38,467
No man should know too
much about his own destiny.

1743
02:01:38,552 --> 02:01:39,927
You don't understand. I do understand.

1744
02:01:40,011 --> 02:01:41,220
If I know too much about my own future,

1745
02:01:41,304 --> 02:01:42,721
I can endanger my own existence.

1746
02:01:42,806 --> 02:01:45,140
Just as you've endangered yours.

1747
02:01:47,102 --> 02:01:49,019
You're right. Now...

1748
02:01:49,104 --> 02:01:51,981
Let me show you my plan
for sending you home.

1749
02:01:52,065 --> 02:01:53,816
Please excuse the crudity of this model.

1750
02:01:53,900 --> 02:01:56,235
I didn't have time to build
it to scale or paint it.

1751
02:01:56,319 --> 02:01:58,237
It's good. Thank you. Thank you.

1752
02:01:59,531 --> 02:02:00,739
Okay, now.

1753
02:02:00,824 --> 02:02:03,033
We run some industrial-strength
electrical cable

1754
02:02:03,118 --> 02:02:04,952
from the top of the clock tower

1755
02:02:05,036 --> 02:02:06,662
down, suspending it over the street

1756
02:02:06,746 --> 02:02:08,330
between these two lamp posts.

1757
02:02:08,957 --> 02:02:11,417
Meanwhile, we've
outfitted the time vehicle

1758
02:02:11,501 --> 02:02:12,960
with this big pole and hook,

1759
02:02:13,044 --> 02:02:16,005
which runs directly
into the flux capacitor.

1760
02:02:16,923 --> 02:02:21,594
At the calculated moment, you
start off from down the street,

1761
02:02:21,678 --> 02:02:22,928
driving directly toward the cable,

1762
02:02:23,013 --> 02:02:25,931
accelerating to 88 miles per hour.

1763
02:02:26,266 --> 02:02:29,643
According to the flyer, at precisely
10:04 p.m. This Saturday night,

1764
02:02:29,728 --> 02:02:33,355
lightning will strike the clock
tower, electrifying the cable

1765
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:35,691
just as the connecting
hook makes contact

1766
02:02:35,775 --> 02:02:39,403
thereby sending 1.21 gigawatts
into the flux capacitor

1767
02:02:39,779 --> 02:02:41,947
and sending you back to 1985.

1768
02:02:42,032 --> 02:02:44,074
All right, now. Watch this.

1769
02:02:44,159 --> 02:02:46,076
You wind up the car and release it.

1770
02:02:47,871 --> 02:02:50,080
I'll simulate the lightning.

1771
02:02:58,381 --> 02:02:59,548
Ready.

1772
02:03:09,309 --> 02:03:10,434
Set.

1773
02:03:15,482 --> 02:03:16,732
Release.

1774
02:03:35,126 --> 02:03:37,294
You're instilling me with
a lot of confidence, Doc.

1775
02:03:37,379 --> 02:03:38,754
Don't worry. I'll take
care of the lightning.

1776
02:03:38,838 --> 02:03:41,423
You take care of your pop.

1777
02:03:42,592 --> 02:03:45,594
By the way, what happened
today? Did he ask her out?

1778
02:03:45,679 --> 02:03:46,804
I think so.

1779
02:03:46,888 --> 02:03:47,930
What did she say?

1780
02:03:56,606 --> 02:03:58,357
It's your mom! She's tracked you down!

1781
02:03:58,441 --> 02:04:00,693
Quick! Let's cover the time machine.

1782
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:16,500
Hi, Cal... Marty.

1783
02:04:17,001 --> 02:04:18,419
Mom. Lorraine.

1784
02:04:19,963 --> 02:04:22,172
How did you know I was here?

1785
02:04:23,091 --> 02:04:24,633
I followed you.

1786
02:04:25,468 --> 02:04:27,469
Oh. This is my doc...

1787
02:04:27,554 --> 02:04:30,639
My uncle, Doc Brown.

1788
02:04:31,975 --> 02:04:33,225
Hi. Hi.

1789
02:04:36,312 --> 02:04:39,481
Marty, this may seem a little forward,

1790
02:04:39,858 --> 02:04:44,069
but I was kind of
wondering if you'd ask me

1791
02:04:44,154 --> 02:04:47,990
to the Enchantment Under
the Sea dance on Saturday.

1792
02:04:50,660 --> 02:04:53,871
Wow, you mean... You
mean nobody's asked you?

1793
02:04:54,539 --> 02:04:57,624
No. Not yet.

1794
02:04:59,335 --> 02:05:00,878
What about George?

1795
02:05:00,962 --> 02:05:02,755
George McFly?

1796
02:05:05,300 --> 02:05:09,303
He's kind of cute and all, but not...

1797
02:05:10,180 --> 02:05:14,308
Well, I think a man should be strong,

1798
02:05:16,227 --> 02:05:18,479
so he can stand up for himself

1799
02:05:19,522 --> 02:05:21,774
and protect the woman he loves.

1800
02:05:26,488 --> 02:05:27,863
Don't you?

1801
02:05:29,365 --> 02:05:30,449
Yeah.

1802
02:05:30,909 --> 02:05:32,910
I still don't understand.

1803
02:05:33,369 --> 02:05:36,079
How am I supposed to
go to the dance with her

1804
02:05:36,164 --> 02:05:38,916
if she's already going
to the dance with you?

1805
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,668
Well, because, George,
she wants to go with you.

1806
02:05:41,753 --> 02:05:43,670
She just doesn't know it yet.

1807
02:05:43,755 --> 02:05:44,755
That's why we got to show her

1808
02:05:44,839 --> 02:05:46,799
that you, George McFly, are a fighter.

1809
02:05:46,883 --> 02:05:48,801
You're somebody who's
gonna stand up for yourself,

1810
02:05:48,885 --> 02:05:50,344
somebody who's gonna protect her.

1811
02:05:50,428 --> 02:05:53,639
Yeah, but I've never picked
a fight in my entire life.

1812
02:05:53,723 --> 02:05:56,475
Look, you're not going to
be picking a fight, Dad.

1813
02:05:56,559 --> 02:05:58,769
Daddy-o.

1814
02:05:58,853 --> 02:06:01,146
You're coming to her rescue, right?

1815
02:06:01,231 --> 02:06:02,397
Okay, let's go over the plan again.

1816
02:06:02,482 --> 02:06:04,233
8:55, where are you going to be?

1817
02:06:04,317 --> 02:06:05,901
I'm going to be at the dance.

1818
02:06:05,985 --> 02:06:07,027
Right. And where am I going to be?

1819
02:06:07,111 --> 02:06:09,112
You're gonna be in the car with her.

1820
02:06:09,197 --> 02:06:10,656
Right, okay. So, right around 9:00,

1821
02:06:10,740 --> 02:06:12,157
she's going to get very angry with me.

1822
02:06:12,242 --> 02:06:14,660
Why is she going to get angry with you?

1823
02:06:14,744 --> 02:06:17,079
Well, because, George,
nice girls get angry

1824
02:06:17,163 --> 02:06:19,414
when guys take advantage of them.

1825
02:06:21,668 --> 02:06:23,669
You mean you're going
to go touch her on her...

1826
02:06:23,753 --> 02:06:26,213
No. No, George, look.

1827
02:06:27,048 --> 02:06:29,007
It's just an act, right?

1828
02:06:29,300 --> 02:06:32,803
Okay. So, 9:00, you're strolling
through the parking lot.

1829
02:06:33,221 --> 02:06:36,431
You see us struggling in the car.

1830
02:06:36,850 --> 02:06:40,018
You walk up, you open
the door, and you say...

1831
02:06:41,646 --> 02:06:43,397
Your line, George.

1832
02:06:44,691 --> 02:06:45,858
Oh!

1833
02:06:46,526 --> 02:06:49,361
Hey, you, get your damn hands off her!

1834
02:06:51,698 --> 02:06:53,031
You really think I ought to swear?

1835
02:06:53,116 --> 02:06:54,116
Yes, definitely.

1836
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:55,826
God damn it, George, swear.

1837
02:06:55,910 --> 02:06:57,911
Okay. So, now you come up.

1838
02:06:57,996 --> 02:06:59,121
You punch me in the stomach.

1839
02:06:59,205 --> 02:07:00,998
I'm out for the count, right?

1840
02:07:01,082 --> 02:07:04,293
And you and Lorraine
live happily ever after.

1841
02:07:04,377 --> 02:07:06,587
You make it sound so easy.

1842
02:07:06,671 --> 02:07:09,131
I just... I wish I wasn't so scared.

1843
02:07:09,215 --> 02:07:10,465
George, there's nothing to be scared of.

1844
02:07:10,550 --> 02:07:13,093
All it takes is a
little self-confidence.

1845
02:07:13,177 --> 02:07:15,888
You know, if you put your mind to it,

1846
02:07:15,972 --> 02:07:17,431
you can accomplish anything.

1847
02:07:31,100 --> 02:07:34,603
This is heavy, Doc. I mean, it's
like I was just here yesterday.

1848
02:07:34,687 --> 02:07:36,438
You were here yesterday,
Marty. You were.

1849
02:07:36,522 --> 02:07:37,772
Amazing, isn't it?

1850
02:07:37,857 --> 02:07:41,026
All right, sunrise should
be in about 22 minutes.

1851
02:07:41,110 --> 02:07:44,404
You go into town. Track
down Young Biff and tail him.

1852
02:07:44,488 --> 02:07:47,115
Sometime today,
Old Biff will show up

1853
02:07:47,199 --> 02:07:48,617
to give Young Biff
the almanac.

1854
02:07:48,701 --> 02:07:50,785
Above all you, must not
interfere with that event.

1855
02:07:50,870 --> 02:07:53,830
We must let Old Biff believe he's
succeeded, so that he'll leave 1955

1856
02:07:53,914 --> 02:07:55,165
and bring the DeLorean
back to the future.

1857
02:07:55,249 --> 02:07:56,291
Right.

1858
02:07:56,375 --> 02:07:59,502
Once Old Biff is gone, grab the
almanac any way that you can.

1859
02:07:59,587 --> 02:08:01,755
Remember, both of our
futures depend on this.

1860
02:08:01,839 --> 02:08:03,798
You don't have to
remind me of that, Doc.

1861
02:08:03,883 --> 02:08:08,470
Here's some binoculars and a
walkie-talkie so we can keep in contact.

1862
02:08:08,554 --> 02:08:11,598
I'll stay here and try to repair
the short in the time circuit.

1863
02:08:11,682 --> 02:08:14,476
That way, we don't risk anyone
else stealing the time machine,

1864
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:18,855
and I won't risk accidentally
running into my other self.

1865
02:08:18,939 --> 02:08:19,939
Other self?

1866
02:08:20,024 --> 02:08:22,192
Yes. There are now
two of me here,

1867
02:08:22,276 --> 02:08:24,152
and there are
two of you here.

1868
02:08:24,236 --> 02:08:28,323
The other me is the Dr.
Emmett Brown from 1955,

1869
02:08:28,407 --> 02:08:33,370
the younger me that helps the
other you get back to 1985.

1870
02:08:34,121 --> 02:08:35,747
Remember the lightning bolt
at the clock tower?

1871
02:08:35,831 --> 02:08:37,832
Yeah. That event doesn't
happen until tonight,

1872
02:08:37,917 --> 02:08:40,502
so you must be very careful
not to run into your other self.

1873
02:08:40,586 --> 02:08:41,753
Let me give you
some money.

1874
02:08:45,591 --> 02:08:48,843
I have to be prepared for
all monetary possibilities.

1875
02:08:48,928 --> 02:08:50,178
Get yourself
some '50s clothes.

1876
02:08:50,262 --> 02:08:51,888
Check, Doc.

1877
02:08:53,099 --> 02:08:54,933
Something inconspicuous.

1878
02:08:56,185 --> 02:08:58,853
Doc. Come in, Doc.
This is Marty. Over.

1879
02:08:58,938 --> 02:09:01,147
Roger, Marty. This is Doc.
Are you there?

1880
02:09:01,232 --> 02:09:04,734
Yeah, Doc.
I'm at the address.

1881
02:09:04,819 --> 02:09:06,027
It's the only Tannen
in the book,

1882
02:09:06,112 --> 02:09:08,113
but I don't think
this is Biff's house.

1883
02:09:08,197 --> 02:09:10,073
It looks like some
old lady lives here.

1884
02:09:10,157 --> 02:09:11,825
Biff!
Yeah.

1885
02:09:12,326 --> 02:09:14,285
Where are you
going, Biff?

1886
02:09:14,370 --> 02:09:16,454
I'm going to get
my car, Grandma.

1887
02:09:16,539 --> 02:09:17,664
When are you
coming back?

1888
02:09:17,748 --> 02:09:20,208
My feet hurt, and I want
you to rub my toes some more.

1889
02:09:20,292 --> 02:09:22,293
Shut up,
you old bag.

1890
02:09:22,378 --> 02:09:24,713
Give us
our ball back.

1891
02:09:24,797 --> 02:09:26,589
What ball?
That ball!

1892
02:09:26,674 --> 02:09:28,717
What ball are
you talking about?

1893
02:09:28,801 --> 02:09:30,468
Give us our ball!

1894
02:09:30,553 --> 02:09:32,303
What ball?
Biff!

1895
02:09:32,513 --> 02:09:34,222
Is this your ball?
Yeah!

1896
02:09:34,306 --> 02:09:35,765
Is it your ball?
You want it back?

1897
02:09:35,850 --> 02:09:37,308
Yeah.

1898
02:09:38,978 --> 02:09:40,395
Go get it.

1899
02:09:44,024 --> 02:09:48,319
Doc, it is Biff's house.
I'm on him. Over.

1900
02:09:56,495 --> 02:09:57,620
Hey.

1901
02:10:00,291 --> 02:10:01,416
Looking good, Terry.

1902
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:03,126
Hey, Biff, she's all
fixed up just like new,

1903
02:10:03,210 --> 02:10:04,794
but I couldn't
get her started.

1904
02:10:04,879 --> 02:10:06,713
You got some kind of
kill switch on this thing?

1905
02:10:06,797 --> 02:10:08,423
No, you just gotta
have the right touch.

1906
02:10:08,507 --> 02:10:10,300
Nobody can start
this car but me.

1907
02:10:10,384 --> 02:10:12,302
Yeah, the bill
comes to $302.57.

1908
02:10:12,386 --> 02:10:13,553
300 bucks?

1909
02:10:13,637 --> 02:10:15,346
300 bucks for
a couple of dents?

1910
02:10:15,431 --> 02:10:16,681
No, hey,
that's bullshit, Terry.

1911
02:10:16,766 --> 02:10:17,974
No, Biff,
it was horse shit.

1912
02:10:18,058 --> 02:10:19,184
The whole car
was full of it.

1913
02:10:19,268 --> 02:10:21,311
We had to pay Old Man Jones
80 bucks to haul it away.

1914
02:10:21,395 --> 02:10:22,729
Old Man Jones
probably resold it, too.

1915
02:10:22,813 --> 02:10:23,938
Now I ought to get
something for that.

1916
02:10:24,023 --> 02:10:25,148
You want
something for it?

1917
02:10:25,232 --> 02:10:27,025
We'll go inside. You
can call Old Man Jones.

1918
02:10:27,109 --> 02:10:28,151
If he wants to
give you a refund...

1919
02:10:28,235 --> 02:10:29,778
It's 300 bucks, Terry.

1920
02:10:29,862 --> 02:10:33,448
If I catch the guy that caused
this, I'll break his neck.

1921
02:10:33,866 --> 02:10:36,743
The manure.
I remember that.

1922
02:10:43,292 --> 02:10:45,293
Four cans of Valvoline
is fair, Biff.

1923
02:10:45,377 --> 02:10:46,961
Four cans
for a $300 job?

1924
02:10:47,046 --> 02:10:48,505
I couldn't even
have lunch in the shop.

1925
02:10:48,547 --> 02:10:49,756
Makes me nauseous. I
should get a case of oil

1926
02:10:49,882 --> 02:10:51,716
out of you for a 300 buck
job. You've been inside.

1927
02:10:51,801 --> 02:10:53,468
It smells worse than the
bathroom at a gas station.

1928
02:10:53,552 --> 02:10:54,844
You robbed me again,
Terry. Yeah, yeah.

1929
02:10:54,929 --> 02:10:56,679
The smell's never
gonna go away, Biff.

1930
02:10:56,764 --> 02:10:57,764
Never gonna go away.

1931
02:10:57,890 --> 02:10:59,432
Last time I do you a favor.
Last time. Thanks a lot.

1932
02:11:01,894 --> 02:11:02,894
Let me see.

1933
02:11:07,066 --> 02:11:08,817
It's perfect,
Lorraine.

1934
02:11:08,901 --> 02:11:10,026
Oh, look at it!

1935
02:11:10,110 --> 02:11:11,736
You're going to
look so good!

1936
02:11:16,617 --> 02:11:17,659
You're going
to look...

1937
02:11:17,743 --> 02:11:19,327
Well, lookey
what we have here.

1938
02:11:19,411 --> 02:11:20,495
Hey, nice dress,
Lorraine.

1939
02:11:20,579 --> 02:11:22,997
Although, I think you'd look
better wearing nothing at all.

1940
02:11:23,082 --> 02:11:25,959
Biff, why don't you take a
long walk off a short pier?

1941
02:11:26,043 --> 02:11:27,085
Hey, listen, Lorraine.

1942
02:11:27,169 --> 02:11:28,503
There's that dance at
school tonight, right.

1943
02:11:28,587 --> 02:11:29,754
Now that
my car's all fixed,

1944
02:11:29,839 --> 02:11:31,047
I figure
I'd cut you a break

1945
02:11:31,131 --> 02:11:32,382
and give you
the honor of going

1946
02:11:32,466 --> 02:11:33,883
with the best-looking
guy in school.

1947
02:11:33,968 --> 02:11:35,009
Yeah, well, I'm busy.

1948
02:11:35,094 --> 02:11:36,678
Yeah, doing what?
Washing my hair.

1949
02:11:36,762 --> 02:11:39,430
That's about as funny as a
screen door on a battleship.

1950
02:11:39,515 --> 02:11:41,558
Screen door on
a submarine, you dork.

1951
02:11:41,642 --> 02:11:44,269
Look, Biff, somebody already
asked me to the dance.

1952
02:11:44,854 --> 02:11:47,188
Who? That bug
George McFly?

1953
02:11:47,648 --> 02:11:50,316
I'm going with
Calvin Klein, okay?

1954
02:11:50,401 --> 02:11:52,110
Calvin Klein?
No, it's not okay.

1955
02:11:52,736 --> 02:11:54,362
You're going
with me, understand?

1956
02:11:54,446 --> 02:11:55,738
Get your cooties
off me!

1957
02:11:55,823 --> 02:11:57,991
When are you gonna get it through
your thick skull, Lorraine?

1958
02:11:58,075 --> 02:11:59,367
You're my girl.

1959
02:11:59,451 --> 02:12:01,244
Biff Tannen,
I wouldn't be your girl

1960
02:12:01,328 --> 02:12:03,997
even if you had
a million dollars!

1961
02:12:07,626 --> 02:12:10,044
Yes, you will! It's
you and me, Lorraine.

1962
02:12:11,213 --> 02:12:12,422
Watch it!

1963
02:12:12,506 --> 02:12:14,299
It's meant to be.

1964
02:12:14,383 --> 02:12:16,551
I'm going to marry
you someday, Lorraine.

1965
02:12:16,635 --> 02:12:18,553
Someday you'll
be my wife!

1966
02:12:21,807 --> 02:12:24,309
You always did
have a way with women.

1967
02:12:24,393 --> 02:12:26,394
Get the hell out
of my car, old man.

1968
02:12:26,478 --> 02:12:27,937
You want to marry
that girl, Biff?

1969
02:12:28,022 --> 02:12:29,397
I can help
make it happen.

1970
02:12:29,481 --> 02:12:31,566
Oh, yeah? Who are you,
Miss Lonely-Hearts?

1971
02:12:31,650 --> 02:12:34,402
Just get in the car,
butthead.

1972
02:12:34,528 --> 02:12:36,946
Who are you calling
butthead, butthead?

1973
02:12:37,656 --> 02:12:38,781
How do you know
how to do that?

1974
02:12:38,866 --> 02:12:41,326
Nobody can start
this car but me.

1975
02:12:41,410 --> 02:12:44,954
Just get in the car, Tannen.
Today's your lucky day.

1976
02:12:47,541 --> 02:12:51,169
Hey! Hey! Hey, watch where
you're driving, old man.

1977
02:12:51,712 --> 02:12:53,254
If you dent this car,
I'll kill you.

1978
02:13:00,012 --> 02:13:01,804
This cost me
300 bucks!

1979
02:13:01,889 --> 02:13:03,932
Would you shut up
about the car?

1980
02:13:04,391 --> 02:13:06,309
Hey, and another thing. How
do you know where I live?

1981
02:13:06,393 --> 02:13:08,603
Let's just say
we're related, Biff.

1982
02:13:08,687 --> 02:13:11,230
And that being the case, I
got a little present for you.

1983
02:13:11,315 --> 02:13:13,441
Something that'll
make you rich.

1984
02:13:13,525 --> 02:13:14,525
You want to be rich,
don't you?

1985
02:13:14,610 --> 02:13:17,528
Oh, yeah. Sure. Right.
That's rich.

1986
02:13:17,613 --> 02:13:19,530
You're going
to make me rich?

1987
02:13:20,074 --> 02:13:23,284
You see this book? This
book tells the future.

1988
02:13:23,369 --> 02:13:25,370
Tells the results of
every major sports event

1989
02:13:25,454 --> 02:13:26,663
till the end
of the century.

1990
02:13:26,747 --> 02:13:30,708
Football, baseball,
horse races, boxing.

1991
02:13:31,835 --> 02:13:35,630
The information in here is worth
millions, and I'm giving it to you.

1992
02:13:35,714 --> 02:13:38,299
Well, that's very nice.
Thank you very much.

1993
02:13:38,384 --> 02:13:42,220
Now, why don't you make like
a tree and get out of here?

1994
02:13:43,222 --> 02:13:46,975
It's leave, you idiot.
Make like a tree and leave.

1995
02:13:47,059 --> 02:13:49,268
You sound like a damn fool
when you say it wrong.

1996
02:13:49,353 --> 02:13:53,231
All right, then, leave and
take your book with you.

1997
02:13:53,315 --> 02:13:56,985
Don't you get it? You could
make a fortune with this book.

1998
02:13:57,069 --> 02:13:58,528
Let me show you.

1999
02:14:02,825 --> 02:14:05,535
UCLA trails 17-16.

2000
02:14:05,619 --> 02:14:08,955
It's 4th and 11 with only
18 seconds left of this game.

2001
02:14:09,039 --> 02:14:12,166
I'd say it's
all over for UCLA.

2002
02:14:12,251 --> 02:14:16,004
Bet you a million bucks
UCLA wins it 19-17.

2003
02:14:16,088 --> 02:14:17,255
What are you,
deaf, old man?

2004
02:14:17,339 --> 02:14:19,674
He just said it was over.
You lost.

2005
02:14:19,758 --> 02:14:21,217
Oh, yeah?

2006
02:14:21,677 --> 02:14:23,011
Here comes Decker
with the kick.

2007
02:14:23,095 --> 02:14:24,595
It's up.
It looks good, folks!

2008
02:14:24,680 --> 02:14:28,975
It looks very good. Field
goal! UCLA wins 19-17.

2009
02:14:29,268 --> 02:14:33,187
Listen to that Coliseum
crowd go wild. Jim Decker...

2010
02:14:33,272 --> 02:14:34,522
All right, pops.
What's the gag?

2011
02:14:34,606 --> 02:14:36,524
How did you know what
the score was gonna be?

2012
02:14:36,608 --> 02:14:38,818
I told you.
It's in this book.

2013
02:14:38,902 --> 02:14:42,447
All you gotta do is bet on the
winner, and you'll never lose.

2014
02:14:48,037 --> 02:14:50,621
All right.
I'll take a look at it.

2015
02:14:53,042 --> 02:14:55,126
You damn fool!

2016
02:14:55,210 --> 02:14:58,129
Never, never leave
this book laying around.

2017
02:14:58,213 --> 02:15:01,132
Don't you have a safe?
No, you don't have a safe.

2018
02:15:02,301 --> 02:15:05,136
Get a safe.
Keep it locked up.

2019
02:15:05,220 --> 02:15:07,096
And until then, keep
it on you like this.

2020
02:15:07,181 --> 02:15:08,222
Hey, what are you doing?

2021
02:15:08,307 --> 02:15:10,141
And don't tell anybody about it, either.

2022
02:15:10,225 --> 02:15:11,476
And there's
one more thing.

2023
02:15:11,560 --> 02:15:15,396
One day, a kid or a
crazy, wild-eyed old man

2024
02:15:15,481 --> 02:15:17,023
who claims to
be a scientist

2025
02:15:17,107 --> 02:15:19,567
is going to come around
asking about this...

2026
02:15:22,196 --> 02:15:24,489
If that ever happens...

2027
02:15:44,176 --> 02:15:46,469
I'm trapped. Doc.

2028
02:15:46,678 --> 02:15:47,845
Doc, come in, Doc.

2029
02:15:47,930 --> 02:15:49,764
Marty, what's the report?
Biff's gone.

2030
02:15:50,307 --> 02:15:51,432
He's got the book.

2031
02:15:51,517 --> 02:15:53,559
The old man's gone, too.
I'm locked in Biff's garage.

2032
02:15:53,644 --> 02:15:54,811
You gotta fly
the DeLorean over here

2033
02:15:54,895 --> 02:15:56,020
and get me
the hell out of here.

2034
02:15:56,355 --> 02:15:58,106
The address is
1809 Mason Street.

2035
02:15:58,190 --> 02:16:00,108
I can't take the DeLorean
out in the daylight,

2036
02:16:00,192 --> 02:16:02,110
but don't worry, Marty.
Somehow I'll get over there.

2037
02:16:02,194 --> 02:16:05,530
Doc, wait a minute.
Doc. Hey, Doc. Doc.

2038
02:16:07,116 --> 02:16:08,533
Perfect.

2039
02:16:15,457 --> 02:16:18,251
I told you, Grandma.
I'm going to the dance.

2040
02:16:18,377 --> 02:16:20,336
When you coming home?
The dance.

2041
02:16:20,420 --> 02:16:23,172
I'll get home
when I get home.

2042
02:16:24,466 --> 02:16:27,385
Don't forget to turn
off the garage light.

2043
02:16:59,334 --> 02:17:00,960
Marty. Marty!

2044
02:17:01,420 --> 02:17:02,837
Marty.

2045
02:17:04,840 --> 02:17:07,300
Marty, Marty. Damn!

2046
02:17:08,093 --> 02:17:10,178
Where is that kid?

2047
02:17:12,100 --> 02:17:14,310
...Hill Valley area
weather this Saturday night.

2048
02:17:14,394 --> 02:17:17,396
Mostly clear, with
some scattered clouds.

2049
02:17:17,481 --> 02:17:19,190
Lows tonight in the upper 40s.

2050
02:17:19,274 --> 02:17:21,192
Are you sure about this storm?

2051
02:17:22,027 --> 02:17:26,197
Since when can weathermen predict
the weather, let alone the future?

2052
02:17:26,698 --> 02:17:29,367
You know, Marty, I'm going
to be very sad to see you go.

2053
02:17:29,451 --> 02:17:30,660
You've really made a
difference in my life.

2054
02:17:30,744 --> 02:17:32,870
You've given me something to shoot for.

2055
02:17:32,955 --> 02:17:37,124
Just knowing that I'm going
to be around to see 1985.

2056
02:17:37,209 --> 02:17:39,126
That I'm going to succeed in this!

2057
02:17:39,211 --> 02:17:42,755
That I'm going to have a
chance to travel through time!

2058
02:17:48,220 --> 02:17:50,888
It's going to be really hard waiting
30 years before I can talk to you

2059
02:17:50,973 --> 02:17:53,933
about everything that's
happened in the past few days.

2060
02:17:54,017 --> 02:17:56,602
I'm really going to miss you, Marty.

2061
02:17:57,938 --> 02:17:59,772
I'm really going to miss you.

2062
02:18:04,152 --> 02:18:05,319
Doc, about the future...

2063
02:18:05,404 --> 02:18:06,487
No!

2064
02:18:07,155 --> 02:18:09,490
Marty! We've already agreed

2065
02:18:09,574 --> 02:18:10,866
that having information about the future

2066
02:18:10,951 --> 02:18:12,410
can be extremely dangerous.

2067
02:18:12,494 --> 02:18:13,995
Even if your intentions are good,

2068
02:18:14,079 --> 02:18:16,038
it can backfire drastically.

2069
02:18:17,290 --> 02:18:18,499
Whatever you've got to tell me,

2070
02:18:18,583 --> 02:18:21,669
I'll find out through the
natural course of time.

2071
02:18:28,200 --> 02:18:30,285
Doc. Doc, come in.

2072
02:18:30,953 --> 02:18:32,495
Come in, Doc.

2073
02:18:33,247 --> 02:18:34,330
Marty! Marty, come in.

2074
02:18:34,623 --> 02:18:35,832
Doc.

2075
02:18:39,670 --> 02:18:40,962
Marty.

2076
02:18:42,006 --> 02:18:43,631
Oh, my...

2077
02:18:45,301 --> 02:18:47,302
Great Scott.

2078
02:19:02,902 --> 02:19:04,277
Oh, my God.

2079
02:19:09,491 --> 02:19:10,617
Doc, Doc, come in.

2080
02:19:10,701 --> 02:19:12,327
Marty,
what happened to you?

2081
02:19:12,411 --> 02:19:13,953
I went to Biff's house,
and you weren't there.

2082
02:19:14,038 --> 02:19:15,079
You must have
just missed me.

2083
02:19:15,164 --> 02:19:16,205
I'm in the back
of Biff's car.

2084
02:19:16,290 --> 02:19:18,333
He's on his way to the
Enchantment Under the Sea dance.

2085
02:19:19,251 --> 02:19:21,252
Marty, listen, we may have
to abort this entire plan.

2086
02:19:21,337 --> 02:19:22,754
It's getting
much too dangerous.

2087
02:19:22,838 --> 02:19:24,422
Don't worry. The book
is on Biff's dashboard.

2088
02:19:24,506 --> 02:19:25,840
I'll grab it as soon
as we get to the school.

2089
02:19:25,925 --> 02:19:28,009
Marty, you must
be extremely careful

2090
02:19:28,093 --> 02:19:29,469
not to run into
your other self.

2091
02:19:29,553 --> 02:19:31,179
My other self?
Yes.

2092
02:19:31,889 --> 02:19:36,017
Remember, your mother is at that
exact same dance with you. Yeah.

2093
02:19:36,101 --> 02:19:38,269
Right. This could
get heavy, Doc.

2094
02:19:38,354 --> 02:19:39,520
Heavy, heavy.

2095
02:19:39,605 --> 02:19:42,231
Marty, whatever happens, you must
not let your other self see you!

2096
02:19:42,316 --> 02:19:44,525
The consequences
could be disastrous.

2097
02:19:44,610 --> 02:19:45,902
Excuse me, sir.

2098
02:19:47,071 --> 02:19:48,613
Yes, you with the hat.

2099
02:19:48,697 --> 02:19:49,781
Who, me?

2100
02:19:49,865 --> 02:19:50,907
Yes.

2101
02:19:51,283 --> 02:19:55,036
Be a pal and hand me a five-eighths
inch wrench out of that toolbox.

2102
02:19:56,121 --> 02:19:57,705
Five-eighths?

2103
02:19:59,375 --> 02:20:01,793
Don't you mean
three-quarters?

2104
02:20:02,544 --> 02:20:04,629
Why, you're right.

2105
02:20:05,422 --> 02:20:10,051
I presume you're conducting
some sort of weather experiment.

2106
02:20:12,054 --> 02:20:15,139
That's right.
How did you know that?

2107
02:20:15,224 --> 02:20:19,185
I happen to have had a little
experience in this area.

2108
02:20:19,269 --> 02:20:21,938
Yes, well, I'm hoping to
see some lightning tonight.

2109
02:20:22,022 --> 02:20:25,066
Although, the weatherman says
there's not gonna be any rain.

2110
02:20:25,150 --> 02:20:26,442
There's going to be
plenty of rain, all right.

2111
02:20:26,527 --> 02:20:28,736
Wind, thunder,
lightning.

2112
02:20:28,821 --> 02:20:30,530
It's gonna be one
hell of a storm.

2113
02:20:30,614 --> 02:20:33,408
Well, thanks.
Nice talking to you.

2114
02:20:33,492 --> 02:20:37,328
Maybe we'll bump into each other
some time again in the future.

2115
02:20:38,330 --> 02:20:39,956
Or in the past.

2116
02:20:52,100 --> 02:20:54,059
"Dear Dr. Brown.

2117
02:20:54,811 --> 02:20:57,270
"On the night that I go back in time,

2118
02:20:57,730 --> 02:20:59,481
"you will be

2119
02:21:00,066 --> 02:21:02,359
"shot by terrorists.

2120
02:21:03,486 --> 02:21:05,946
"Please take whatever
precautions are necessary

2121
02:21:06,030 --> 02:21:08,490
"to prevent this terrible disaster.

2122
02:21:09,909 --> 02:21:11,618
"Your friend,

2123
02:21:12,662 --> 02:21:13,912
"Marty."

2124
02:21:23,339 --> 02:21:26,299
'Evening, Dr. Brown.
What's with the wire?

2125
02:21:26,384 --> 02:21:29,302
Oh, just a little weather experiment.

2126
02:21:31,139 --> 02:21:32,139
What you got under here?

2127
02:21:32,223 --> 02:21:33,223
No! Don't touch that!

2128
02:21:33,307 --> 02:21:36,101
Some new, specialized
weather-sensing equipment.

2129
02:21:36,185 --> 02:21:38,395
You got a permit for that?

2130
02:21:38,479 --> 02:21:39,771
Of course I do.

2131
02:21:47,238 --> 02:21:50,365
Just a second. Let me
see if I can find it here.

2132
02:22:46,800 --> 02:22:48,550
Doc, Doc! Come in!

2133
02:24:01,791 --> 02:24:04,585
Where's that punk
Calvin Klein, anyway?

2134
02:24:04,669 --> 02:24:05,711
How am I
supposed to know, Biff?

2135
02:24:05,795 --> 02:24:06,879
I ain't his secretary.

2136
02:24:06,963 --> 02:24:09,882
Well, go find him. He caused
300 bucks damage to my car,

2137
02:24:09,966 --> 02:24:12,509
and I owe him a knuckle
sandwich. Get going!

2138
02:24:12,594 --> 02:24:13,886
Drink up, Biff.
Yeah, thanks.

2139
02:24:13,970 --> 02:24:14,970
Ain't you coming?

2140
02:24:15,054 --> 02:24:16,263
I'm reading.

2141
02:24:55,100 --> 02:24:59,686
Do you mind if we park for a while?

2142
02:25:00,897 --> 02:25:02,898
That's a great idea. I'd love to park.

2143
02:25:02,982 --> 02:25:03,982
Huh?

2144
02:25:04,067 --> 02:25:06,777
Marty, I'm almost 18 years old.

2145
02:25:06,861 --> 02:25:08,779
It's not like I've never parked before.

2146
02:25:09,572 --> 02:25:10,864
What?

2147
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:23,333
We're going to take a little break,

2148
02:25:23,418 --> 02:25:24,918
but we'll be back in a while,

2149
02:25:25,003 --> 02:25:27,588
so don't nobody go nowhere.

2150
02:25:58,800 --> 02:26:01,010
Well, well, well,
Mr. Tannen.

2151
02:26:02,137 --> 02:26:03,888
How nice
to see you here.

2152
02:26:03,972 --> 02:26:07,057
Why, Mr. Strickland,
it's nice to see you, sir.

2153
02:26:07,142 --> 02:26:08,517
Is that liquor
I smell, Tannen?

2154
02:26:09,060 --> 02:26:10,561
I wouldn't know.

2155
02:26:10,645 --> 02:26:11,896
I don't know what
liquor smells like,

2156
02:26:11,980 --> 02:26:13,188
'cause I'm too
young to drink it.

2157
02:26:13,273 --> 02:26:14,607
I see.

2158
02:26:15,066 --> 02:26:16,942
And what have we here?

2159
02:26:20,488 --> 02:26:23,991
Sports statistics, interesting
subject. Homework, Tannen?

2160
02:26:24,075 --> 02:26:26,911
No, it ain't homework,
'cause I ain't at home.

2161
02:26:28,997 --> 02:26:30,122
You've got a real
attitude problem.

2162
02:26:30,206 --> 02:26:31,790
You know that, Tannen?
Just watch it.

2163
02:26:31,875 --> 02:26:32,917
Because one day,
I'll have you

2164
02:26:33,001 --> 02:26:35,461
right where I want you
in detention.

2165
02:26:35,545 --> 02:26:36,670
Slacker!

2166
02:26:43,500 --> 02:26:46,502
Marty, you seem so
nervous. Is something wrong?

2167
02:26:46,587 --> 02:26:49,881
No.

2168
02:26:54,637 --> 02:26:57,055
Lorraine! Lorraine, what are you doing?

2169
02:26:57,514 --> 02:26:59,849
I swiped it from the old
lady's liquor cabinet.

2170
02:26:59,934 --> 02:27:02,852
Yeah, well, you shouldn't drink.

2171
02:27:02,937 --> 02:27:03,895
Why not?

2172
02:27:03,979 --> 02:27:05,021
Because you...

2173
02:27:05,773 --> 02:27:08,524
You might regret it later in life.

2174
02:27:09,568 --> 02:27:11,486
Marty, don't be such a square.

2175
02:27:16,200 --> 02:27:18,118
Everybody who's anybody drinks.

2176
02:27:23,200 --> 02:27:25,160
Jesus,
you smoke, too?

2177
02:27:25,244 --> 02:27:27,996
Marty, you're beginning to
sound just like my mother.

2178
02:27:28,080 --> 02:27:29,497
Yeah, right.

2179
02:27:29,582 --> 02:27:32,876
When I have kids, I'm going to
let them do anything they want.

2180
02:27:32,960 --> 02:27:34,461
Anything at all.

2181
02:27:34,545 --> 02:27:36,129
Yeah, I'd like to
have that in writing.

2182
02:27:36,213 --> 02:27:37,464
Yeah, me, too.

2183
02:27:37,548 --> 02:27:40,300
Marty,
why are you so nervous?

2184
02:27:46,100 --> 02:27:47,476
Lorraine.

2185
02:27:48,394 --> 02:27:52,564
Have you ever been in a situation

2186
02:27:52,648 --> 02:27:54,441
where you knew you had
to act a certain way,

2187
02:27:54,525 --> 02:27:56,693
but when you got there, you didn't know

2188
02:27:56,778 --> 02:27:58,528
if you could go through with it?

2189
02:27:58,613 --> 02:28:02,073
You mean like how you're
supposed to act on a first date?

2190
02:28:02,158 --> 02:28:03,408
Sort of.

2191
02:28:04,202 --> 02:28:06,870
I think I know exactly what you mean.

2192
02:28:07,705 --> 02:28:08,997
You do?

2193
02:28:09,499 --> 02:28:12,125
You know what I do in those situations?

2194
02:28:12,210 --> 02:28:13,335
What?

2195
02:28:13,419 --> 02:28:14,461
I don't worry.

2196
02:28:56,100 --> 02:28:59,727
This is all wrong. I
don't know what it is.

2197
02:29:01,397 --> 02:29:04,858
But when I kiss you,
it's like I'm kissing

2198
02:29:06,652 --> 02:29:08,027
my brother.

2199
02:29:08,320 --> 02:29:11,030
I guess that doesn't
make any sense, does it?

2200
02:29:11,115 --> 02:29:15,118
Believe me, it makes perfect sense.

2201
02:30:36,600 --> 02:30:38,309
Somebody's coming.

2202
02:30:42,231 --> 02:30:46,442
You caused 300 bucks damage
to my car, you son of a bitch.

2203
02:30:46,527 --> 02:30:49,821
And I'm going to take it
out of your ass. Hold him.

2204
02:30:50,739 --> 02:30:53,157
Let him go, Biff. You're drunk.

2205
02:30:53,992 --> 02:30:56,452
Well, look-ey what we have here.

2206
02:30:59,248 --> 02:31:02,875
No, no! You're staying right
here with me. Come on, Lorraine.

2207
02:31:02,960 --> 02:31:04,001
Let me go!

2208
02:31:04,086 --> 02:31:05,336
Leave her alone, you bastard!

2209
02:31:05,420 --> 02:31:07,255
Take him in back, all
right? I'll be right there.

2210
02:31:07,339 --> 02:31:10,424
Just admit that
you want it. Come on.

2211
02:31:10,509 --> 02:31:12,802
Well, go on. This ain't no peep show.

2212
02:31:19,560 --> 02:31:20,685
Hey, let's put him in there.

2213
02:31:20,769 --> 02:31:22,145
Yeah!

2214
02:31:23,564 --> 02:31:25,898
That's for messing up my hair.

2215
02:31:25,983 --> 02:31:28,067
What the hell are you doing to my car?

2216
02:31:28,152 --> 02:31:30,611
Hey, beat it, spook.
This don't concern you.

2217
02:31:33,198 --> 02:31:35,783
Who you calling "spook," peckerwood?

2218
02:31:37,244 --> 02:31:38,911
Hey, hey, listen, guys...

2219
02:31:38,996 --> 02:31:41,581
Look, I don't want to mess
with no reefer addicts, okay?

2220
02:31:41,665 --> 02:31:43,499
Get home to your mama, boy.

2221
02:31:43,584 --> 02:31:44,667
Biff!

2222
02:31:44,751 --> 02:31:45,835
Hurry, Biff!

2223
02:31:46,378 --> 02:31:48,212
Let me out of here!

2224
02:31:50,007 --> 02:31:51,507
Reginald, where are your keys?

2225
02:31:51,592 --> 02:31:53,759
The keys are in the trunk.

2226
02:31:54,219 --> 02:31:55,344
Say that again?

2227
02:31:55,429 --> 02:31:57,263
I said, the keys are in here.

2228
02:32:14,600 --> 02:32:15,767
Yes!

2229
02:32:19,564 --> 02:32:20,647
No!

2230
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:40,424
"Oh Là Là?"

2231
02:32:46,180 --> 02:32:47,514
Doc! Doc!

2232
02:32:47,598 --> 02:32:48,765
Hey, you.

2233
02:32:48,850 --> 02:32:50,434
Doc, come in!

2234
02:32:50,518 --> 02:32:51,768
Marty, what's up?

2235
02:32:51,800 --> 02:32:53,175
Oh.

2236
02:32:53,260 --> 02:32:55,886
I think you got the wrong car, McFly.

2237
02:32:57,180 --> 02:32:59,223
George, help me! Please!

2238
02:32:59,307 --> 02:33:02,184
Just turn around, McFly, and walk away.

2239
02:33:03,228 --> 02:33:04,228
Please, George.

2240
02:33:04,312 --> 02:33:05,396
Are you deaf, McFly?

2241
02:33:05,480 --> 02:33:07,565
Close the door and beat it.

2242
02:33:10,152 --> 02:33:13,737
No, Biff. You leave her alone.

2243
02:33:15,100 --> 02:33:17,601
Doc! I'm in trouble.
I blew it.

2244
02:33:17,686 --> 02:33:18,811
Where's the book?

2245
02:33:18,895 --> 02:33:20,104
Biff must still
have it with him.

2246
02:33:20,271 --> 02:33:21,605
All I got is
the damn cover.

2247
02:33:21,690 --> 02:33:22,898
And where's Biff?

2248
02:33:22,982 --> 02:33:25,025
You're asking for it.
I don't know.

2249
02:33:25,110 --> 02:33:26,402
Don't you have any
idea where he is?

2250
02:33:26,486 --> 02:33:28,821
No! I mean, he could
be anywhere by now.

2251
02:33:28,905 --> 02:33:30,447
Marty, the entire
future depends on you

2252
02:33:30,532 --> 02:33:32,533
finding Biff and
getting that book back!

2253
02:33:32,617 --> 02:33:33,951
I know.
I just don't know where...

2254
02:33:34,035 --> 02:33:35,536
Stop it!

2255
02:33:35,620 --> 02:33:39,123
Stop it, Biff. You'll
break his arm. Stop it!

2256
02:33:43,211 --> 02:33:44,628
Of course!

2257
02:33:45,296 --> 02:33:47,339
I gotta go.
I got one chance!

2258
02:33:47,424 --> 02:33:49,466
My old man is
about to deck Biff!

2259
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:55,493
Give me a hand here, Reginald.

2260
02:33:56,829 --> 02:33:59,122
Damn it, man! I sliced my hand!

2261
02:33:59,206 --> 02:34:00,665
Whose are these? Mine.

2262
02:34:00,749 --> 02:34:02,667
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

2263
02:34:03,800 --> 02:34:05,000
...leave him alone!

2264
02:34:05,100 --> 02:34:06,560
Let him go! Let him go!

2265
02:34:25,800 --> 02:34:27,009
Yes!

2266
02:34:40,315 --> 02:34:41,899
Talk about déjà vu.

2267
02:34:42,150 --> 02:34:43,776
Are you okay?

2268
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:16,501
The storm.

2269
02:35:19,200 --> 02:35:21,118
Okay, everybody,
let's back up now.

2270
02:35:21,202 --> 02:35:23,328
Let's back up. Let's
everybody just back up

2271
02:35:23,413 --> 02:35:24,788
and give him a little bit of room, okay.

2272
02:35:24,872 --> 02:35:25,872
A little bit of air.

2273
02:35:25,957 --> 02:35:28,875
It's okay.
I know CPR. I know CPR.

2274
02:35:28,960 --> 02:35:30,085
Hey.

2275
02:35:30,169 --> 02:35:31,545
What's CPR?

2276
02:35:31,629 --> 02:35:32,713
You!

2277
02:35:36,551 --> 02:35:37,551
He's fine.

2278
02:35:37,635 --> 02:35:39,636
Hey, did you
just take his wallet?

2279
02:35:39,721 --> 02:35:41,430
He just took
that guy's wallet.

2280
02:35:43,600 --> 02:35:46,310
Hey, guys, you gotta get back
in there and finish the dance.

2281
02:35:46,394 --> 02:35:47,811
Hey, man. Look at Marvin's hand.

2282
02:35:47,896 --> 02:35:49,021
He can't play with his hand like that,

2283
02:35:49,105 --> 02:35:50,231
and we can't play without him.

2284
02:35:50,315 --> 02:35:52,775
Yeah, well. Look,
Marvin, you got to play.

2285
02:35:52,859 --> 02:35:55,027
See, that's where they kiss for
the first time on the dance floor.

2286
02:35:55,111 --> 02:35:56,820
And if there's no
music, they can't dance.

2287
02:35:56,905 --> 02:35:58,197
If they can't dance, they can't kiss.

2288
02:35:58,281 --> 02:36:00,658
If they can't kiss, they can't
fall in love and I'm history.

2289
02:36:00,742 --> 02:36:01,909
Hey, man, the dance is over

2290
02:36:01,993 --> 02:36:04,537
unless you know somebody
else that can play the guitar.

2291
02:36:04,700 --> 02:36:07,119
Doc, success.
I got it.

2292
02:36:07,203 --> 02:36:09,121
Thank goodness.

2293
02:36:10,123 --> 02:36:11,790
Great, Marty.

2294
02:36:11,874 --> 02:36:13,792
As soon as I reload
the fusion generator,

2295
02:36:13,876 --> 02:36:16,253
I'll meet you on the roof
of the high school gym.

2296
02:36:16,337 --> 02:36:17,796
On the roof. 10-4.

2297
02:36:17,880 --> 02:36:19,464
Hey, it's him!

2298
02:36:19,549 --> 02:36:20,841
Hey, he's in disguise.

2299
02:36:20,925 --> 02:36:22,801
Guys, what's that?

2300
02:36:24,637 --> 02:36:26,346
Come on!
Let's get him!

2301
02:36:33,604 --> 02:36:34,729
Damn!

2302
02:36:51,200 --> 02:36:53,618
This is for all you lovers out there.

2303
02:36:56,205 --> 02:37:00,250
Earth angel, Earth angel

2304
02:37:01,001 --> 02:37:03,628
Will you be mine?

2305
02:37:04,213 --> 02:37:06,881
My darling dear

2306
02:37:07,675 --> 02:37:09,509
George, aren't you going to kiss me?

2307
02:37:09,593 --> 02:37:11,094
I don't know.

2308
02:37:12,888 --> 02:37:15,014
Scram, McFly. I'm cutting in.

2309
02:37:22,022 --> 02:37:25,984
Earth angel, Earth angel

2310
02:37:26,652 --> 02:37:28,486
The one I adore

2311
02:37:28,571 --> 02:37:30,572
Hey, boy, you all right?

2312
02:37:31,699 --> 02:37:33,157
I can't play.

2313
02:37:33,242 --> 02:37:34,325
George!

2314
02:37:51,802 --> 02:37:53,052
George!

2315
02:37:54,471 --> 02:37:55,638
George.

2316
02:37:58,684 --> 02:38:00,101
Excuse me.

2317
02:38:09,528 --> 02:38:12,155
The vision of your happiness

2318
02:38:14,325 --> 02:38:17,535
Earth angel, Earth angel

2319
02:38:18,203 --> 02:38:21,414
Please be mine

2320
02:38:21,999 --> 02:38:24,125
My darling dear

2321
02:38:24,460 --> 02:38:27,503
Love you for all time

2322
02:38:28,297 --> 02:38:31,549
I'm just a fool

2323
02:38:32,635 --> 02:38:35,678
A fool in love

2324
02:38:36,931 --> 02:38:40,350
with you

2325
02:38:46,200 --> 02:38:48,243
All right!
Let's do another one.

2326
02:38:48,536 --> 02:38:52,302
-Where did he go?
-Come on, man. Let's do
something that really cooks.

2327
02:38:52,387 --> 02:38:55,180
Something that cooks.

2328
02:39:00,562 --> 02:39:01,603
All right.

2329
02:39:01,688 --> 02:39:02,688
All right!

2330
02:39:06,693 --> 02:39:08,068
All right.

2331
02:39:08,100 --> 02:39:09,559
Look! How did he
get up on stage?

2332
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:14,419
All right, this is an oldie, but...

2333
02:39:16,422 --> 02:39:18,715
-Well...
-When he gets
down, we're gonna nail him.

2334
02:39:18,799 --> 02:39:21,217
How the hell did he
change his clothes so fast?

2335
02:39:21,301 --> 02:39:23,550
Well, it's an oldie where I come from.

2336
02:39:23,600 --> 02:39:25,851
All right, guys, listen,
this is a blues riff in B.

2337
02:39:25,935 --> 02:39:28,979
Watch me for the changes,
and try and keep up, okay?

2338
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:35,292
Doc. Doc, come in!

2339
02:39:35,376 --> 02:39:36,585
Marty, come in.

2340
02:39:36,669 --> 02:39:41,214
Listen, Biff's guys chased me into
the gym, and they're going to jump me.

2341
02:39:41,299 --> 02:39:42,716
Then get out of there!

2342
02:39:42,800 --> 02:39:44,718
No, Doc, not me.
The other me.

2343
02:39:44,802 --> 02:39:47,137
The one that's up on stage
playing Johnny B. Goode.

2344
02:39:47,221 --> 02:39:48,763
Great Scott!
Your other self will miss

2345
02:39:48,848 --> 02:39:50,015
the lightning bolt
at the clock tower,

2346
02:39:50,099 --> 02:39:52,100
you won't get back to the future,
and we'll have a major paradox!

2347
02:39:52,184 --> 02:39:54,144
Wait, wait, wait.
A paradox?

2348
02:39:54,228 --> 02:39:56,563
You mean one of those things
that can destroy the universe?

2349
02:39:56,647 --> 02:39:58,940
Precisely. Marty, you have to
stop those guys at all costs,

2350
02:39:59,025 --> 02:40:01,985
but without being seen by your
other self or your parents.

2351
02:40:02,069 --> 02:40:03,320
10-4.

2352
02:40:04,100 --> 02:40:06,101
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

2353
02:40:06,978 --> 02:40:08,520
Go, Johnny, go, go

2354
02:40:08,605 --> 02:40:11,231
Hey, George, I heard you
laid out Biff. Nice going.

2355
02:40:11,316 --> 02:40:13,609
George, you ever think of
running for class president?

2356
02:40:13,693 --> 02:40:16,111
Johnny B. Goode

2357
02:40:18,448 --> 02:40:21,116
Go, Johnny, go, go

2358
02:40:21,201 --> 02:40:23,869
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

2359
02:40:23,953 --> 02:40:26,705
Go, Johnny, go, go

2360
02:40:26,789 --> 02:40:28,999
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

2361
02:40:30,585 --> 02:40:32,461
Johnny B. Goode

2362
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:34,334
What the hell?

2363
02:40:38,005 --> 02:40:39,506
Where is he?
Who?

2364
02:40:39,590 --> 02:40:41,132
Calvin Klein.
Who?

2365
02:40:41,217 --> 02:40:42,425
The guy with the hat,
where is he?

2366
02:40:42,510 --> 02:40:44,636
Oh. He went that way.

2367
02:40:44,720 --> 02:40:48,473
I think he took your wallet.
I think he took his wallet.

2368
02:40:49,225 --> 02:40:51,142
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

2369
02:40:52,895 --> 02:40:54,521
Johnny B. Goode

2370
02:41:12,999 --> 02:41:14,332
Go, go

2371
02:41:14,750 --> 02:41:16,710
Go, Johnny, go, go

2372
02:41:17,545 --> 02:41:19,546
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

2373
02:41:20,423 --> 02:41:22,507
Go, Johnny, go, go

2374
02:41:23,342 --> 02:41:25,385
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

2375
02:41:26,887 --> 02:41:28,346
Johnny B. Goode

2376
02:41:50,900 --> 02:41:53,735
Chuck! Chuck, it's Marvin.

2377
02:41:53,820 --> 02:41:56,405
Your cousin, Marvin Berry.

2378
02:41:56,489 --> 02:41:59,241
You know that new sound
you're looking for?

2379
02:41:59,325 --> 02:42:01,201
Well, listen to this.

2380
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,961
I guess you guys aren't
ready for that yet.

2381
02:43:08,296 --> 02:43:09,922
But your kids are going to love it.

2382
02:43:19,300 --> 02:43:21,634
Hey, Doc, success.
Everything's cool.

2383
02:43:21,719 --> 02:43:24,888
Great. I'll be landing at the
school roof in about one minute.

2384
02:43:24,972 --> 02:43:26,639
I'll be there.

2385
02:43:34,148 --> 02:43:35,398
Lorraine.

2386
02:43:35,483 --> 02:43:38,860
Marty, that was
very interesting music.

2387
02:43:44,500 --> 02:43:46,084
Yeah.

2388
02:43:46,628 --> 02:43:48,086
I hope you don't mind,

2389
02:43:48,171 --> 02:43:50,213
but George asked if
he could take me home.

2390
02:43:50,465 --> 02:43:53,383
Great! Good. Good, Lorraine.

2391
02:43:53,468 --> 02:43:54,885
I had a feeling about you two.

2392
02:43:55,345 --> 02:43:57,304
I have a feeling, too.

2393
02:43:57,600 --> 02:43:59,267
Hey, butthead!

2394
02:44:00,186 --> 02:44:03,104
You think that stupid
disguise would get by me?

2395
02:44:03,940 --> 02:44:07,943
Let's have it out.
You and me, right now.

2396
02:44:08,986 --> 02:44:10,445
No, thanks.

2397
02:44:12,900 --> 02:44:16,402
Well, good luck, you guys.

2398
02:44:17,700 --> 02:44:19,785
What's the matter?

2399
02:44:19,869 --> 02:44:21,870
-Where are you going?
-Oh

2400
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:26,920
One other thing. If
you guys ever have kids,

2401
02:44:27,004 --> 02:44:29,422
and one of them, when
he's eight years old,

2402
02:44:29,507 --> 02:44:32,509
accidentally sets fire
to the living room rug,

2403
02:44:33,844 --> 02:44:35,470
go easy on him.

2404
02:44:36,472 --> 02:44:37,664
Okay.

2405
02:44:37,700 --> 02:44:39,409
Are you chicken?

2406
02:44:40,661 --> 02:44:43,871
That's it, isn't it?
Nothing but a little chicken.

2407
02:44:58,512 --> 02:45:02,181
Nobody
calls me chicken.

2408
02:45:10,200 --> 02:45:13,035
Marty. Such a nice name.

2409
02:45:14,500 --> 02:45:15,917
What the hell?

2410
02:45:18,045 --> 02:45:19,880
You steal my stuff?

2411
02:45:21,674 --> 02:45:23,759
And this one's
for my car!

2412
02:45:49,410 --> 02:45:50,535
Doc!

2413
02:45:50,745 --> 02:45:52,788
Doc! I blew it.

2414
02:45:53,456 --> 02:45:54,706
Biff nailed me.
He took the book.

2415
02:45:54,791 --> 02:45:56,958
He drove away
with it in his car.

2416
02:45:57,043 --> 02:45:59,169
It's my fault, Doc. I should
have got out of there sooner.

2417
02:45:59,253 --> 02:46:01,129
No time for that now.
Which way did he go?

2418
02:46:01,214 --> 02:46:02,297
East towards
the River Road Tunnel.

2419
02:46:02,381 --> 02:46:03,381
Get in!

2420
02:46:14,727 --> 02:46:16,311
Yes!

2421
02:46:16,395 --> 02:46:17,896
There he is, Doc!

2422
02:46:18,272 --> 02:46:20,232
Let's land on him.
We'll cripple his car.

2423
02:46:20,316 --> 02:46:22,234
Marty, he's in a '46 Ford.
We're a DeLorean.

2424
02:46:22,318 --> 02:46:24,861
He'd rip through us
like we were tin foil.

2425
02:46:24,946 --> 02:46:26,947
So what do we do?
I have a plan.

2426
02:46:27,031 --> 02:46:29,115
Repeating tonight's
earlier weather bulletin,

2427
02:46:29,200 --> 02:46:31,743
a severe thunderstorm is
heading for Hill Valley.

2428
02:46:54,183 --> 02:46:56,268
Serving Hill Valley
and all of Hill County,

2429
02:46:56,352 --> 02:46:59,437
you're tuned to KKHV,
the voice of Hill Valley.

2430
02:47:07,613 --> 02:47:09,281
Turning to
community calendar,

2431
02:47:09,365 --> 02:47:11,157
the Hill Valley
Women's Club bake sale

2432
02:47:11,242 --> 02:47:12,534
will be held
tomorrow afternoon

2433
02:47:12,618 --> 02:47:16,371
from 2:00 to 5:00 at the
community center on Forest Road.

2434
02:47:16,455 --> 02:47:17,706
For you sports fans
out there,

2435
02:47:17,790 --> 02:47:20,292
there was a lot of action
today in college football.

2436
02:47:20,376 --> 02:47:22,460
Here's what happened
to the top 10.

2437
02:47:22,545 --> 02:47:26,214
UCLA narrowly
defeated Washington 19-17.

2438
02:47:26,299 --> 02:47:29,634
Michigan State
crushed Minnesota 42-14.

2439
02:47:29,719 --> 02:47:32,429
Ohio State
beat Iowa 20-10.

2440
02:47:32,513 --> 02:47:33,972
Michigan
blanked Indiana 30-0.

2441
02:47:34,056 --> 02:47:35,140
Shit.

2442
02:47:35,224 --> 02:47:36,933
It was Notre Dame over
North Carolina, 27-7.

2443
02:47:37,018 --> 02:47:38,351
Son of a bitch.

2444
02:47:38,436 --> 02:47:41,354
Oklahoma ripped
Iowa State 52-0.

2445
02:47:42,315 --> 02:47:45,108
West Virginia lost
to Pittsburgh 26-7.

2446
02:47:45,484 --> 02:47:48,445
Texas A&M over Rice 20-10.

2447
02:47:48,529 --> 02:47:51,114
Maryland
defeated Clemson 25-12,

2448
02:47:51,198 --> 02:47:55,243
and it was Texas
Christian over Texas 47-20.

2449
02:47:55,328 --> 02:47:58,914
Repeating tonight's earlier
weather bulletin, a severe...

2450
02:47:58,998 --> 02:48:01,499
You again?
Give me that book.

2451
02:48:03,961 --> 02:48:05,253
Let it go!

2452
02:48:08,049 --> 02:48:09,257
Whoa!

2453
02:48:12,678 --> 02:48:14,679
Let go of the car!

2454
02:48:48,214 --> 02:48:49,881
That'll teach him.

2455
02:49:50,443 --> 02:49:51,943
Oh!

2456
02:50:24,310 --> 02:50:25,977
Go, Doc!

2457
02:50:26,062 --> 02:50:27,604
Hold on, Marty!

2458
02:50:32,610 --> 02:50:33,985
Shit!

2459
02:50:40,826 --> 02:50:41,868
Yes!

2460
02:50:52,213 --> 02:50:55,173
Manure!
I hate manure!

2461
02:51:02,600 --> 02:51:04,726
Damn! Where is that kid?

2462
02:51:07,939 --> 02:51:09,189
Damn!

2463
02:51:11,651 --> 02:51:13,026
Damn! Damn!

2464
02:51:20,868 --> 02:51:23,745
You're late! Do you
have no concept of time?

2465
02:51:23,830 --> 02:51:26,206
Hey, come on. I had to change.

2466
02:51:26,291 --> 02:51:29,209
Do you think I'm going
back in that zoot suit?

2467
02:51:29,294 --> 02:51:31,962
The old man really
came through. It worked.

2468
02:51:32,046 --> 02:51:34,131
He laid out Biff in one punch.

2469
02:51:34,215 --> 02:51:35,299
I didn't know he had it in him.

2470
02:51:35,383 --> 02:51:38,593
He's never stood up to Biff in his life.

2471
02:51:39,971 --> 02:51:41,138
Never?

2472
02:51:41,222 --> 02:51:42,973
No. Why? What's the matter?

2473
02:51:44,058 --> 02:51:47,769
All right! Let's set
your destination time.

2474
02:51:52,525 --> 02:51:54,860
This is the exact time you left.

2475
02:51:55,236 --> 02:51:58,697
Let's send you back at
exactly the same time.

2476
02:52:01,576 --> 02:52:03,785
It'll be like you never left.

2477
02:52:05,538 --> 02:52:09,958
Now, I painted a white line
on the street way over there.

2478
02:52:10,043 --> 02:52:11,918
That's where you'll start from.

2479
02:52:12,003 --> 02:52:14,338
I've calculated the precise distance,

2480
02:52:14,422 --> 02:52:17,090
taking into account
the acceleration speed

2481
02:52:17,175 --> 02:52:18,925
and wind resistance retroactive

2482
02:52:19,010 --> 02:52:21,636
from the moment the lightning strikes,

2483
02:52:21,721 --> 02:52:26,224
which will be in exactly
7 minutes and 22 seconds.

2484
02:52:26,601 --> 02:52:28,977
When this alarm goes
off, you hit the gas.

2485
02:52:29,062 --> 02:52:30,145
Right.

2486
02:52:36,944 --> 02:52:39,988
Well, I guess that's everything.

2487
02:52:44,202 --> 02:52:45,660
Thanks.

2488
02:52:45,745 --> 02:52:46,953
Thank you.

2489
02:52:51,959 --> 02:52:54,086
See you in about 30 years.

2490
02:52:55,797 --> 02:52:57,130
I hope so.

2491
02:52:58,800 --> 02:53:00,342
Don't worry!

2492
02:53:01,010 --> 02:53:02,719
As long as you hit that wire

2493
02:53:02,804 --> 02:53:05,889
with the connecting hook at
precisely 88 miles an hour,

2494
02:53:05,973 --> 02:53:08,975
the instant the lightning
strikes the tower

2495
02:53:11,437 --> 02:53:12,562
everything will be fine.

2496
02:53:12,647 --> 02:53:13,814
Right.

2497
02:53:22,698 --> 02:53:24,658
What's the meaning of this?

2498
02:53:24,742 --> 02:53:26,410
You'll find out in 30 years.

2499
02:53:26,494 --> 02:53:28,578
It's about the future, isn't it?

2500
02:53:28,663 --> 02:53:29,746
It's information about the future.

2501
02:53:29,831 --> 02:53:31,373
Wait a minute.

2502
02:53:31,457 --> 02:53:33,375
I warned you about this, kid.

2503
02:53:33,459 --> 02:53:36,294
The consequences could be disastrous!

2504
02:53:36,379 --> 02:53:38,797
Doc, that's a risk you're
going to have to take.

2505
02:53:38,881 --> 02:53:40,465
Your life depends on it!

2506
02:53:40,550 --> 02:53:41,716
No!

2507
02:53:42,176 --> 02:53:45,512
I refuse to accept the responsibility.

2508
02:53:45,847 --> 02:53:47,806
In that case, I'll
tell you straight out.

2509
02:53:52,562 --> 02:53:53,979
Great Scott!

2510
02:54:01,904 --> 02:54:04,948
You get the cable, I'll
throw the rope down to you.

2511
02:54:05,032 --> 02:54:06,825
Right! I got it!

2512
02:54:38,300 --> 02:54:40,926
Doc, is everything
all right? Over.

2513
02:54:41,011 --> 02:54:43,721
10-4, Marty, but it's pretty
miserable flying weather.

2514
02:54:43,805 --> 02:54:45,389
Much too turbulent to make a
landing from this direction.

2515
02:54:45,473 --> 02:54:47,892
I'll have to circle around and
make a long approach from the south.

2516
02:54:47,976 --> 02:54:50,477
Have you got the book?

2517
02:54:50,562 --> 02:54:53,147
In my hand, Doc!
I got it in my hand!

2518
02:54:53,231 --> 02:54:54,982
Burn it!

2519
02:54:55,066 --> 02:54:56,400
Check!

2520
02:55:51,873 --> 02:55:54,833
Doc! Doc!
That newspaper changed.

2521
02:55:54,918 --> 02:55:56,543
Doc, my father's alive!

2522
02:55:56,628 --> 02:55:59,505
That means everything's
back to normal, right?

2523
02:56:03,218 --> 02:56:04,885
Mission accomplished.

2524
02:56:05,512 --> 02:56:08,097
That means Jennifer's okay
and Einie's okay, right?

2525
02:56:08,181 --> 02:56:11,308
That's right, Marty.
It's the ripple effect.

2526
02:56:11,393 --> 02:56:13,435
The future is back,
so let's go home.

2527
02:56:13,520 --> 02:56:16,313
Right. Let's get our
asses back to the...

2528
02:56:22,612 --> 02:56:24,405
Doc, Doc,
are you okay?

2529
02:56:24,739 --> 02:56:27,950
That was a close one, Marty.
I almost bought the farm.

2530
02:56:31,287 --> 02:56:35,082
Well, be careful. You don't
want to get struck by lightning.

2531
02:56:49,305 --> 02:56:50,431
Doc.

2532
02:56:59,441 --> 02:57:00,482
Doc?

2533
02:57:01,651 --> 02:57:03,360
Doc, come in, Doc.

2534
02:57:05,030 --> 02:57:06,905
Doc, do you read me?

2535
02:57:07,824 --> 02:57:11,243
Do you read me, Doc?
Come in. Doc.

2536
02:57:24,174 --> 02:57:25,382
Oh, no.

2537
02:57:33,975 --> 02:57:35,476
He's gone.

2538
02:57:37,479 --> 02:57:39,146
The doc's gone.

2539
02:58:02,003 --> 02:58:03,337
Mr. McFly!

2540
02:58:04,130 --> 02:58:05,172
Huh?

2541
02:58:08,009 --> 02:58:10,511
Is your name
Marty McFly?

2542
02:58:15,517 --> 02:58:17,017
Yeah.

2543
02:58:18,853 --> 02:58:21,105
I've got something for you.

2544
02:58:23,399 --> 02:58:25,025
A letter.

2545
02:58:26,111 --> 02:58:27,861
A letter for me?

2546
02:58:28,947 --> 02:58:30,572
That's impossible.

2547
02:58:32,200 --> 02:58:33,408
Who the hell are you?

2548
02:58:33,493 --> 02:58:34,618
Western Union.

2549
02:58:35,203 --> 02:58:37,621
Actually, a bunch of us at
the office were kind of hoping

2550
02:58:37,705 --> 02:58:39,998
maybe you could shed
some light on the subject.

2551
02:58:40,083 --> 02:58:44,545
See, we've had that envelope in our
possession for the past 70 years.

2552
02:58:47,549 --> 02:58:50,467
It was given to us with
the explicit instructions

2553
02:58:50,552 --> 02:58:54,721
that it be delivered to a
young man with your description

2554
02:58:54,806 --> 02:58:58,600
answering to the name of
Marty at this exact location

2555
02:58:59,435 --> 02:59:03,355
at this exact minute,
November 12, 1955.

2556
02:59:03,898 --> 02:59:05,232
We have a little bet
going as to whether

2557
02:59:05,316 --> 02:59:07,151
this Marty would
actually be here.

2558
02:59:07,235 --> 02:59:08,986
Looks like I lost.

2559
02:59:09,904 --> 02:59:11,363
Did you say 70 years?

2560
02:59:11,447 --> 02:59:14,199
Yeah, 70 years, 2 months,
12 days to be exact.

2561
02:59:14,284 --> 02:59:16,160
Here sign on line 6,
please.

2562
02:59:16,244 --> 02:59:17,619
Here you are.

2563
02:59:27,964 --> 02:59:30,299
It's from the doc!

2564
02:59:34,137 --> 02:59:37,014
"Dear Marty, if my
calculations are correct,

2565
02:59:37,098 --> 02:59:38,682
"you will receive this
letter immediately after

2566
02:59:38,766 --> 02:59:41,685
"you saw the DeLorean
struck by lightning.

2567
02:59:41,769 --> 02:59:44,730
"First, let me assure you
that I'm alive and well.

2568
02:59:44,814 --> 02:59:48,275
"I've been living happily these
past eight months in the year 1885.

2569
02:59:48,359 --> 02:59:51,278
"The lightning bolt... "
1885!

2570
02:59:51,946 --> 02:59:53,447
"September, 1885."

2571
02:59:54,282 --> 02:59:57,701
Wait, wait, kid! Wait a
minute. What's this all about?

2572
02:59:57,785 --> 03:00:00,621
He's alive!
The doc's alive!

2573
03:00:01,372 --> 03:00:03,540
He's in the Old West,
but he's alive.

2574
03:00:03,625 --> 03:00:05,125
Yeah, but, kid,
you all right?

2575
03:00:05,627 --> 03:00:06,835
Do you need any help?

2576
03:00:07,462 --> 03:00:09,671
There's only one man
who can help me.

2577
03:00:34,900 --> 03:00:36,150
Doc!

2578
03:00:43,784 --> 03:00:45,368
Come on, come on. Let's go!

2579
03:00:45,452 --> 03:00:48,120
All right! Take it up!

2580
03:00:51,333 --> 03:00:52,458
Go!

2581
03:00:59,508 --> 03:01:00,508
Doc!

2582
03:01:00,592 --> 03:01:01,634
What?

2583
03:01:01,802 --> 03:01:05,137
I have to tell you about the future.

2584
03:01:05,347 --> 03:01:06,389
What?

2585
03:01:06,473 --> 03:01:09,725
I have to tell you about the future!

2586
03:01:09,810 --> 03:01:11,143
What?

2587
03:01:11,228 --> 03:01:16,065
On the night I go back
in time, you get...

2588
03:01:19,569 --> 03:01:20,820
Doc!

2589
03:01:30,080 --> 03:01:31,288
Go!

2590
03:01:32,165 --> 03:01:33,249
No, Doc!

2591
03:01:33,333 --> 03:01:34,583
Look at the time!

2592
03:01:34,668 --> 03:01:38,671
You've got less than four
minutes. Please, hurry!

2593
03:01:50,267 --> 03:01:51,600
Yeah!

2594
03:02:44,821 --> 03:02:48,115
Damn it, Doc! Why did you
have to tear up that letter?

2595
03:02:48,200 --> 03:02:50,159
If I only had more time.

2596
03:02:53,163 --> 03:02:55,539
Wait a minute. I got
all the time I want.

2597
03:02:55,624 --> 03:02:59,210
I got a time machine. I can
just go back early and warn him.

2598
03:02:59,294 --> 03:03:01,837
Okay. Ten minutes ought to do it.

2599
03:03:03,965 --> 03:03:08,677
Okay. Time circuit's on.
Flux capacitor, fluxing.

2600
03:03:09,137 --> 03:03:11,263
Engine running. All right.

2601
03:03:14,059 --> 03:03:16,101
No. No, no.

2602
03:03:17,646 --> 03:03:19,855
Come on. Not this
time. Come on. Come on.

2603
03:04:30,302 --> 03:04:31,594
Come on.

2604
03:04:33,680 --> 03:04:36,807
Here we go. Here we
go. This time. Come on.

2605
03:04:38,101 --> 03:04:40,978
Please. Please. Come on!

2606
03:06:19,327 --> 03:06:20,703
Doc.

2607
03:07:22,100 --> 03:07:23,809
Doc! Doc! Doc!

2608
03:07:24,602 --> 03:07:26,437
Doc! Doc!
What?

2609
03:07:28,231 --> 03:07:30,524
Okay, relax, Doc. It's
me. It's me! It's Marty.

2610
03:07:30,608 --> 03:07:33,152
No, it can't be. I just
sent you back to the future.

2611
03:07:33,236 --> 03:07:34,361
Yeah. No, I know.
You did send me

2612
03:07:34,446 --> 03:07:36,405
back to the future,
but I'm back.

2613
03:07:36,489 --> 03:07:38,615
I'm back
from the future.

2614
03:07:41,745 --> 03:07:43,412
Great Scott!

2615
03:07:50,900 --> 03:07:52,525
Hey, kids, what time is it?

2616
03:07:52,610 --> 03:07:55,153
Howdy Doody time!

2617
03:07:56,906 --> 03:07:58,698
Great Scott!

2618
03:07:58,783 --> 03:08:02,243
It's Howdy Doody Time

2619
03:08:02,328 --> 03:08:07,999
Bob Smith and Howdy Do
Say Howdy Do to you

2620
03:08:08,084 --> 03:08:09,834
Howdy Doody time?

2621
03:08:15,007 --> 03:08:19,594
Date. Sunday, November
13, 1955. 7:01 a. m.

2622
03:08:19,678 --> 03:08:21,096
Last night's
time travel experiment

2623
03:08:21,180 --> 03:08:23,098
was apparently
a complete success.

2624
03:08:23,182 --> 03:08:25,767
Lightning struck the clock
tower at precisely 10:04 p. m.

2625
03:08:25,851 --> 03:08:28,686
Sending the necessary 1.21
gigawatts into the time vehicle,

2626
03:08:28,771 --> 03:08:30,980
which vanished in a
brilliant flash of light

2627
03:08:31,065 --> 03:08:33,441
leaving a pair of
fire trails behind.

2628
03:08:33,526 --> 03:08:35,610
I, therefore, assume that
Marty and the time vehicle

2629
03:08:35,694 --> 03:08:39,489
were transported forward
through time into the year 1985.

2630
03:08:39,573 --> 03:08:40,657
After that...

2631
03:08:40,741 --> 03:08:43,701
After that, I can't
recall what happened.

2632
03:08:43,786 --> 03:08:46,579
In fact, I don't even
remember how I got home.

2633
03:08:46,664 --> 03:08:48,456
Perhaps
the gigawatt discharge

2634
03:08:48,541 --> 03:08:50,250
coupled with the temporal
displacement field

2635
03:08:50,334 --> 03:08:51,793
generated by
the time vehicle

2636
03:08:51,877 --> 03:08:53,753
caused a disruption
of my own brain waves

2637
03:08:53,838 --> 03:08:56,798
resulting in a condition
of momentary amnesia.

2638
03:08:56,882 --> 03:08:58,174
Indeed, I now recall
that moments

2639
03:08:58,259 --> 03:09:00,176
after the time vehicle
disappeared

2640
03:09:00,261 --> 03:09:01,302
into the future,

2641
03:09:01,387 --> 03:09:03,471
I saw a vision
of Marty saying

2642
03:09:03,556 --> 03:09:05,473
he had come back
from the future.

2643
03:09:05,558 --> 03:09:06,516
Hey, Doc!

2644
03:09:06,600 --> 03:09:07,934
Undoubtedly, this was some
sort of residual image...

2645
03:09:08,018 --> 03:09:09,060
Doc.

2646
03:09:15,067 --> 03:09:18,319
Doc, calm down, okay. Just
calm down. It's me. It's Marty.

2647
03:09:18,404 --> 03:09:20,947
No, it can't be you! I
sent you back to the future!

2648
03:09:21,031 --> 03:09:22,157
That's right, Doc.
That's right,

2649
03:09:22,241 --> 03:09:24,159
but I came back again. I
came back from the future.

2650
03:09:24,243 --> 03:09:25,243
Don't you
remember last night?

2651
03:09:25,327 --> 03:09:26,494
You fainted.
I brought you home.

2652
03:09:26,579 --> 03:09:29,164
This can't be happening!
You can't be here!

2653
03:09:29,248 --> 03:09:30,456
It doesn't make sense
for you to be here!

2654
03:09:30,541 --> 03:09:32,667
I refuse to even believe
that you are here!

2655
03:09:32,751 --> 03:09:34,669
Doc, I am here,
and it does make sense.

2656
03:09:34,753 --> 03:09:37,297
Look, I came back to
1955 again with you,

2657
03:09:37,381 --> 03:09:40,216
the you from 1985, 'cause we
had to get a book from Biff!

2658
03:09:40,301 --> 03:09:41,384
So once I got
the book back,

2659
03:09:41,468 --> 03:09:43,178
you, that is the you
from 1985,

2660
03:09:43,262 --> 03:09:45,013
were in the DeLorean, and
it got struck by lightning,

2661
03:09:45,097 --> 03:09:47,182
and you got
sent back to 1885!

2662
03:09:47,266 --> 03:09:48,600
1885?

2663
03:09:50,853 --> 03:09:53,813
It's a very interesting
story, future boy,

2664
03:09:53,898 --> 03:09:56,608
but there's just one little
thing that doesn't make sense.

2665
03:09:56,692 --> 03:09:59,068
If the me of the future
is now in the past,

2666
03:09:59,153 --> 03:10:01,529
how could you
possibly know about it?

2667
03:10:01,614 --> 03:10:03,031
You sent me a letter.

2668
03:10:03,115 --> 03:10:05,283
"Dear Marty, if my
calculations are correct,

2669
03:10:05,367 --> 03:10:06,868
"you will receive this
letter immediately after

2670
03:10:06,952 --> 03:10:09,621
"you saw the DeLorean
struck by lightning.

2671
03:10:09,705 --> 03:10:12,540
"First, let me assure you
that I'm alive and well.

2672
03:10:12,625 --> 03:10:16,669
"I've been living happily these
past eight months in the year 1885.

2673
03:10:16,754 --> 03:10:18,213
"The lightning bolt
that hit the DeLorean

2674
03:10:18,297 --> 03:10:19,547
"caused a gigawatt
overload

2675
03:10:19,632 --> 03:10:21,216
"which scrambled
the time circuits,

2676
03:10:21,300 --> 03:10:22,884
"activated
the Flux Capacitor,

2677
03:10:22,968 --> 03:10:25,887
"and sent me
back to 1885.

2678
03:10:25,971 --> 03:10:27,722
"The overload shorted
out the time circuits

2679
03:10:27,806 --> 03:10:29,766
"and destroyed
the flying circuits.

2680
03:10:29,850 --> 03:10:32,518
"Unfortunately, the car
will never fly again. "

2681
03:10:32,603 --> 03:10:33,895
It actually flew?

2682
03:10:33,979 --> 03:10:35,647
Yeah, we had
a hover conversion done

2683
03:10:35,731 --> 03:10:37,232
in the early
21st century.

2684
03:10:37,316 --> 03:10:39,234
Incredible!

2685
03:10:39,318 --> 03:10:42,403
"I set myself up as a
blacksmith as a front

2686
03:10:42,488 --> 03:10:45,782
"while I attempted to repair
the damage to the time circuits.

2687
03:10:45,866 --> 03:10:47,700
"Unfortunately,
this proved impossible,

2688
03:10:47,785 --> 03:10:49,327
"because suitable
replacement parts

2689
03:10:49,411 --> 03:10:52,664
"will not be
invented until 1947.

2690
03:10:52,748 --> 03:10:54,290
"However,
I've gotten quite adept

2691
03:10:54,375 --> 03:10:57,710
"at shoeing horses
and fixing wagons. "

2692
03:10:58,837 --> 03:11:01,798
1885! Amazing!

2693
03:11:01,882 --> 03:11:05,134
I actually end up as a
blacksmith in the Old West.

2694
03:11:05,552 --> 03:11:06,928
Pretty heavy, huh?

2695
03:11:07,012 --> 03:11:09,931
"I have buried the DeLorean
in the abandoned Delgado Mine

2696
03:11:10,015 --> 03:11:12,350
"adjacent to the old
Boot Hill Cemetery

2697
03:11:12,434 --> 03:11:14,602
"as shown on
the enclosed map.

2698
03:11:14,687 --> 03:11:16,229
"Hopefully, it should
remain undisturbed

2699
03:11:16,313 --> 03:11:19,774
"and preserved until
you uncover it in 1955.

03:11:21,026 --> 03:11:24,195
"Inside, you will find
repair instructions.

2701
03:11:24,863 --> 03:11:28,324
"My 1955 counterpart... "
That's me.

2702
03:11:28,409 --> 03:11:29,909
"... should have no
problem repairing it

2703
03:11:29,994 --> 03:11:32,578

"Once you have returned to
1985, destroy the time machine. "

2705
03:11:36,709 --> 03:11:38,209
Destroy it?

2706
03:11:38,294 --> 03:11:41,379
Yeah. Well, it's
a long story, Doc.

2707
03:11:41,463 --> 03:11:44,340
"Do not, I repeat,
do not attempt

2708
03:11:44,425 --> 03:11:46,467

03:11:47,052 --> 03:11:51,139
"I am perfectly happy living in
the fresh air and wide-open spaces.

2710
03:11:51,223 --> 03:11:53,725
"And I fear that
unnecessary time travel

2711
03:11:53,809 --> 03:11:55,476
"only risks
further disruption

"of the space-time
continuum.

03:11:57,604 --> 03:12:01,065
"And please take care
of Einstein for me. "

2714
03:12:02,609 --> 03:12:03,735
Einstein?

2715
03:12:03,819 --> 03:12:08,239
He's your dog, Doc. Einstein is
what you call your dog in 1985.

2716
03:12:11,243 --> 03:12:13,202
"I know you will
give him a good home.

2717
03:12:13,287 --> 03:12:14,829
"Remember to
walk him twice a day

03:12:14,913 --> 03:12:17,290

"These are my wishes. Please
respect them and follow them.

2720
03:12:20,669 --> 03:12:25,048
"And so, Marty, I now say
farewell and wish you Godspeed.

2721
03:12:25,132 --> 03:12:27,675
"You've been a good, kind,
and loyal friend to me,

2722
03:12:27,760 --> 03:12:30,470
"and you made a real
difference in my life.

2723
03:12:30,554 --> 03:12:33,014
"I will always treasure
our relationship

03:12:33,098 --> 03:12:35,016
"and think on you
with fond memories,

"warm feelings, and a
special place in my heart.

"Your friend in time,

2727
03:12:43,859 --> 03:12:46,486
"September 1st, 1885."

2728
03:12:48,489 --> 03:12:50,365
I never knew I could
write anything so touching.

2729
03:12:50,449 --> 03:12:52,200
I know. I know, Doc.
It's beautiful.

2730
03:12:55,287 --> 03:12:57,163
It's all right,
Copernicus.

2731
03:12:57,247 --> 03:12:58,456
Everything is
gonna be fine.

2732
03:12:58,540 --> 03:13:01,417
I'm sorry, Doc. It's all my
fault you're stuck back there.

2733
03:13:01,502 --> 03:13:03,086
I never should've
let Biff get to me.

2734
03:13:03,170 --> 03:13:06,047
There are plenty worse places
to be than the Old West.

2735
03:13:06,131 --> 03:13:07,715
I could have ended up
in the Dark Ages.

2736
03:13:07,800 --> 03:13:09,008
They probably
would have burned me

2737
03:13:09,093 --> 03:13:11,552
at the stake as
a heretic or something.

2738
03:13:11,637 --> 03:13:13,221
Let's look at the map.

2739
03:13:13,305 --> 03:13:14,972
All right, according to
this, the time vehicle

2740
03:13:15,057 --> 03:13:18,059
is sealed off
in a side tunnel.

2741
03:13:18,143 --> 03:13:19,644
We may have to blast.

2742
03:13:32,825 --> 03:13:33,991
Whoa!

2743
03:13:34,868 --> 03:13:37,036
I think you woke up
the dead with that blast.

2744
03:13:37,121 --> 03:13:39,831
Take this camera. I want
to document everything!

2745
03:13:42,209 --> 03:13:43,668
This reminds me
of the time

2746
03:13:43,752 --> 03:13:46,087
I attempted to reach
the center of the Earth.

2747
03:13:46,171 --> 03:13:48,714
I'd been reading my
favorite author, Jules Verne.

2748
03:13:48,799 --> 03:13:50,591
I spent weeks preparing
that expedition.

2749
03:13:50,676 --> 03:13:52,343
I didn't even
get this far.

2750
03:13:52,428 --> 03:13:54,971
Of course, I was only 12 at the time.

2751
03:13:55,055 --> 03:13:58,266
You know, it was the
writings of Jules Verne

2752
03:13:58,350 --> 03:14:00,852
that had a profound
effect on my life.

2753
03:14:00,936 --> 03:14:02,437
It was when I was 11
that I first read

2754
03:14:02,521 --> 03:14:04,689
Twenty Thousand
Leagues Under the Sea.

2755
03:14:04,773 --> 03:14:06,357
It was then
that I realized

2756
03:14:06,442 --> 03:14:09,777
that I must devote
my life to science.

2757
03:14:09,862 --> 03:14:12,321
Doc, check it out.
Look at this.

2758
03:14:16,076 --> 03:14:17,618
My initials!

2759
03:14:17,703 --> 03:14:20,037
Just like in Journey to
the Center of the Earth!

2760
03:14:20,122 --> 03:14:21,164
That means
the time machine

2761
03:14:21,206 --> 03:14:22,874
must be right
through this wall!

2762
03:14:44,396 --> 03:14:49,650
It's been buried in here for 70
years, two months, and 13 days.

2763
03:14:49,735 --> 03:14:51,068
Astounding!

2764
03:14:51,153 --> 03:14:53,154
"As you see,
the lightning bolt

2765
03:14:53,238 --> 03:14:56,282
"shorted out the time
circuit control microchip.

2766
03:14:58,452 --> 03:15:00,536
"The attached... "

2767
03:15:00,621 --> 03:15:01,662
Schematic.

2768
03:15:01,747 --> 03:15:05,833
"Schematic diagram will allow
you to build a replacement unit

2769
03:15:05,918 --> 03:15:07,460
"with 1955 components,

2770
03:15:07,544 --> 03:15:10,254
"thus restoring the time machine
to perfect working order. "

2771
03:15:10,339 --> 03:15:12,715
Unbelievable that this
little piece of junk

2772
03:15:12,799 --> 03:15:14,800
could be
such a big problem.

2773
03:15:17,346 --> 03:15:18,888
No wonder this
circuit failed.

2774
03:15:18,972 --> 03:15:20,306
It says,
"Made in Japan. "

2775
03:15:22,100 --> 03:15:25,603
What do you mean, Doc? All the
best stuff is made in Japan.

2776
03:15:27,689 --> 03:15:29,065
Unbelievable!

2777
03:15:35,113 --> 03:15:37,532
You know,
when I was a kid,

2778
03:15:37,616 --> 03:15:39,742
I always wanted
to be a cowboy.

2779
03:15:40,786 --> 03:15:43,329
And now, knowing I'm gonna
spend my future in the past,

2780
03:15:43,413 --> 03:15:47,250
it sounds like a wonderful way
to spend my retirement years.

2781
03:15:47,334 --> 03:15:50,211
It just occurred to me,
Marty, since I end up in 1885,

2782
03:15:50,295 --> 03:15:52,380
perhaps I'm now in
the history books.

2783
03:15:52,464 --> 03:15:54,340
I wonder.

2784
03:15:54,424 --> 03:15:56,175
Could I go to the
library and look myself up

2785
03:15:56,260 --> 03:15:58,511
in the old
newspaper archives?

2786
03:15:58,595 --> 03:15:59,720
I don't know, Doc.

2787
03:15:59,805 --> 03:16:00,972
You're the one that's
always saying, you know,

2788
03:16:01,056 --> 03:16:03,057
it's not good to know too
much about your own destiny.

2789
03:16:03,141 --> 03:16:06,644
You're right, Marty.
I know too much already.

2790
03:16:06,728 --> 03:16:08,062
Better that I not
attempt to uncover

2791
03:16:08,146 --> 03:16:11,899
the circumstances
of my own future.

2792
03:16:11,984 --> 03:16:14,944
Copernicus.
Come on, boy!

2793
03:16:15,487 --> 03:16:17,780
I'll get him, Doc.
Copernicus!

2794
03:16:18,991 --> 03:16:21,826
Copernicus, come on.
Let's go home, boy.

2795
03:16:22,744 --> 03:16:24,745
What's wrong?

2796
03:16:24,830 --> 03:16:28,124
What's wrong,
Copernicus? Come on.

2797
03:16:28,208 --> 03:16:30,876
Come on, let's go home.
Come on. Come on.

2798
03:16:34,590 --> 03:16:37,675
Doc! Doc!
Come here!

2799
03:16:37,759 --> 03:16:39,010
Quick!

2800
03:16:40,846 --> 03:16:44,348
What's wrong, Marty? You
look like you've seen a ghost.

2801
03:16:44,433 --> 03:16:46,559
You're not
far off, Doc.

2802
03:16:50,814 --> 03:16:52,773
Great Scott!

2803
03:16:52,858 --> 03:16:53,983
Check this out.

2804
03:16:54,067 --> 03:16:57,236
"Died September 7th,
1885."

2805
03:16:57,321 --> 03:16:59,030
That's one week after
you wrote the letter!

2806
03:16:59,406 --> 03:17:02,742
"Erected in eternal memory
by his beloved Clara. "

2807
03:17:03,118 --> 03:17:04,619
Who the hell
is Clara?

2808
03:17:04,703 --> 03:17:06,495
Marty, please
don't stand there!

2809
03:17:06,580 --> 03:17:08,122
Oh! Right. Sorry.

2810
03:17:08,206 --> 03:17:10,166
I gotta get
another picture.

2811
03:17:11,543 --> 03:17:15,630
"Shot in the back by Buford
Tannen over a matter of $80"?

2812
03:17:16,214 --> 03:17:18,424
What kind of a future
do you call that?

2813
03:17:19,509 --> 03:17:21,969
"Buford Tannen
was a notorious gunman

2814
03:17:22,054 --> 03:17:24,805
"whose short temper
and a tendency to drool

2815
03:17:24,890 --> 03:17:26,807
"earned him
the nickname Mad Dog.

2816
03:17:26,892 --> 03:17:28,142
"He was quick
on the trigger

2817
03:17:28,226 --> 03:17:30,436
"and bragged that
he had killed 12 men

2818
03:17:30,520 --> 03:17:32,313
"not including
Indians or Chinamen. "

2819
03:17:32,397 --> 03:17:34,106
Does it mention me?
Am I one of the 12?

2820
03:17:34,191 --> 03:17:35,232
Just a minute.

2821
03:17:35,317 --> 03:17:37,109
"However this claim
cannot be substantiated,

2822
03:17:37,194 --> 03:17:38,903
"since precise records
were not kept

2823
03:17:38,987 --> 03:17:40,655
"after Tannen shot
a newspaper editor

2824
03:17:40,739 --> 03:17:43,574
"who printed an unfavorable
story about him in 1884."

2825
03:17:43,659 --> 03:17:44,659
That's why
we can't find anything.

2826
03:17:44,743 --> 03:17:45,743
Look.

2827
03:17:47,329 --> 03:17:50,206
William McFly and family.
Your relatives?

2828
03:17:50,290 --> 03:17:52,833
My great-grandfather's
name was William.

2829
03:17:52,918 --> 03:17:55,419
That's him.
Good-looking guy.

2830
03:17:57,506 --> 03:17:59,840
McFlys, but no Browns.

2831
03:17:59,925 --> 03:18:00,925
Well, maybe it was
a mistake, Doc.

2832
03:18:01,009 --> 03:18:02,093
Maybe that grave
wasn't yours.

2833
03:18:02,177 --> 03:18:04,470
There could've been another
Emmett Brown back in 1885.

2834
03:18:04,554 --> 03:18:05,554
No.
I don't know.

2835
03:18:05,639 --> 03:18:06,722
Did you have any
relatives here back then?

2836
03:18:06,807 --> 03:18:08,849
The Browns didn't come
to Hill Valley until 1908.

2837
03:18:08,934 --> 03:18:10,518
And then they
were the von Brauns.

2838
03:18:10,602 --> 03:18:13,145
My father changed our name
during the First World War.

2839
03:18:13,230 --> 03:18:14,355
Doc, look.

2840
03:18:16,650 --> 03:18:19,652
Great Scott, it's me!

2841
03:18:19,736 --> 03:18:22,655
Then it is true,
all of it.

2842
03:18:22,739 --> 03:18:26,158
It is me who goes back
there and gets shot.

2843
03:18:26,243 --> 03:18:28,661
It's not gonna
happen, Doc.

2844
03:18:28,745 --> 03:18:30,329
After you fix
the time circuits

2845
03:18:30,414 --> 03:18:31,914
and put new tires
on the DeLorean,

2846
03:18:31,998 --> 03:18:35,459
I'm going back to 1885,
and I'm bringing you home.

2847
03:18:47,013 --> 03:18:48,889
The clothes fit?

2848
03:18:48,974 --> 03:18:52,476
Yeah, everything except the
boots, Doc. They're kind of tight.

2849
03:18:52,561 --> 03:18:54,895
I don't know. Are you sure
this stuff is authentic?

2850
03:18:54,980 --> 03:18:58,315
Of course. Haven't
you ever seen a Western?

2851
03:18:59,151 --> 03:19:01,277
Yeah, I have, Doc.

2852
03:19:01,361 --> 03:19:04,238
Clint Eastwood never wore
anything like this.

2853
03:19:05,490 --> 03:19:07,116
Clint who?

2854
03:19:07,200 --> 03:19:09,201
That's right. You
haven't heard of him yet.

2855
03:19:09,286 --> 03:19:11,120
Marty, you have
to wear the boots.

2856
03:19:11,204 --> 03:19:13,914
You can't wear those
futuristic things back in 1885.

2857
03:19:13,999 --> 03:19:15,833
You shouldn't even be
wearing them here in 1955.

2858
03:19:15,917 --> 03:19:17,126
All right, Doc. Look,
as soon as I get there,

2859
03:19:17,210 --> 03:19:18,419
I'll put them on.
I promise.

2860
03:19:18,503 --> 03:19:20,087
Okay. I think
we're about ready.

2861
03:19:20,172 --> 03:19:21,505
I put gas in the tank.

2862
03:19:21,590 --> 03:19:23,090
Your future clothes
are packed.

2863
03:19:23,175 --> 03:19:26,886
Just in case, fresh batteries
for your walkie-talkies.

2864
03:19:27,345 --> 03:19:29,847
Oh! What about that
floating device?

2865
03:19:29,931 --> 03:19:31,891
Hoverboard.
All right.

2866
03:19:34,019 --> 03:19:35,644
You know, Doc, it's gonna
be a hell of a long walk

2867
03:19:35,729 --> 03:19:37,438
back to Hill Valley
from here.

2868
03:19:37,522 --> 03:19:38,814
It's still
the safest plan.

2869
03:19:38,899 --> 03:19:41,609
After all, we can't risk sending
you back into a populated area

2870
03:19:41,693 --> 03:19:43,944
or to a spot that's
geographically unknown.

2871
03:19:44,029 --> 03:19:45,613
You don't want to
crash into some tree

2872
03:19:45,697 --> 03:19:47,406
that once existed
in the past.

2873
03:19:47,491 --> 03:19:49,950
This was all
completely open country,

2874
03:19:50,035 --> 03:19:52,661
so you'll have plenty of run
out space when you arrive.

2875
03:19:52,746 --> 03:19:55,873
Remember, where you're
going, there are no roads.

2876
03:19:55,957 --> 03:19:57,124
There's a small cave
over there

2877
03:19:57,209 --> 03:19:59,585
which will be a perfect place
to hide the time vehicle.

2878
03:19:59,669 --> 03:20:03,422
Well, the new time circuit
control tubes are warmed up.

2879
03:20:06,384 --> 03:20:08,177
Time circuits on.

2880
03:20:08,261 --> 03:20:09,428
I wrote the letter
on September 1st,

2881
03:20:09,513 --> 03:20:11,138
so we'll send you back
the very next day,

2882
03:20:11,223 --> 03:20:12,223
September 2nd.
That's a Wednesday.

2883
03:20:12,307 --> 03:20:14,975
September 2nd,
1885, 8:00 a. m.

2884
03:20:15,060 --> 03:20:16,310
I get shot
on Monday the 7th,

2885
03:20:16,394 --> 03:20:17,728
so you have five days
to locate me.

2886
03:20:17,813 --> 03:20:19,063
According to my letter,
I'm a blacksmith,

2887
03:20:19,147 --> 03:20:21,148
so I probably have
a shop somewhere.

2888
03:20:21,817 --> 03:20:23,818
All you have to do is
drive the time vehicle

2889
03:20:23,902 --> 03:20:25,236
directly toward
that screen,

2890
03:20:25,320 --> 03:20:27,446
accelerating to
88 miles an hour.

2891
03:20:27,531 --> 03:20:30,533
Wait a minute. Doc, if I drive
straight towards the screen,

2892
03:20:30,617 --> 03:20:32,159
I'm gonna crash
into those Indians.

2893
03:20:32,244 --> 03:20:35,579
Marty, you're not thinking
fourth-dimensionally.

2894
03:20:35,664 --> 03:20:37,832
You'll instantly be
transported to 1885,

2895
03:20:37,916 --> 03:20:40,042
and those Indians
won't even be there.

2896
03:20:41,253 --> 03:20:43,128
Right.
Well.

2897
03:20:44,840 --> 03:20:47,508
Good luck for
both of our sakes.

2898
03:20:47,592 --> 03:20:48,843
See you in the future.

2899
03:20:50,011 --> 03:20:51,011
You mean the past.

2900
03:20:51,096 --> 03:20:52,096
Exactly.

2901
03:20:58,937 --> 03:21:00,938
Happy trails, Marty!

2902
03:21:06,528 --> 03:21:07,945
Ready, Marty?

2903
03:21:08,947 --> 03:21:10,114
Ready!

2904
03:21:10,782 --> 03:21:11,991
Set!

2905
03:21:12,075 --> 03:21:13,284
Hi-ho, Silver.

2906
03:22:55,400 --> 03:22:57,109
October is inventory time,

2907
03:22:57,193 --> 03:22:58,819
so right now, Statler Toyota

2908
03:22:58,903 --> 03:23:00,779
is making the best deals of the year

2909
03:23:00,864 --> 03:23:03,032
on all 1985-model Toyotas.

2910
03:23:03,199 --> 03:23:04,658
You won't find a better car

2911
03:23:04,743 --> 03:23:08,037
at a better price with better
service anywhere in Hill Valley.

2912
03:23:08,371 --> 03:23:11,415
That's Statler Toyota
in downtown Hill Valley.

2913
03:23:14,502 --> 03:23:17,379
The Senate is
expected to vote on this today.

2914
03:23:17,464 --> 03:23:21,634
In other news, officials at the
Pacific Nuclear research facility

2915
03:23:21,718 --> 03:23:24,386
have denied the rumor that
a case of missing plutonium

2916
03:23:24,471 --> 03:23:27,723
was in fact stolen from
their vault two weeks ago.

2917
03:23:27,807 --> 03:23:30,267
A Libyan terrorist group
had claimed responsibility

2918
03:23:30,352 --> 03:23:31,560
for the alleged theft.

2919
03:23:31,645 --> 03:23:33,729
However, officials now attribute

2920
03:23:33,813 --> 03:23:36,231
the discrepancy to a
simple clerical error.

2921
03:23:36,733 --> 03:23:40,486
The FBI, which is investigating
the matter, had no comment.

2922
03:24:22,278 --> 03:24:23,570
Hey, Doc?

2923
03:24:26,157 --> 03:24:27,282
Doc?

2924
03:24:28,451 --> 03:24:30,202
Hello! Anybody home?

2925
03:24:30,578 --> 03:24:31,537
Einstein, come here, boy.

2926
03:24:33,289 --> 03:24:35,207
What's going on? Oh, God.

2927
03:24:36,042 --> 03:24:38,001
Oh, Jesus!

2928
03:24:38,628 --> 03:24:41,880
That is disgusting.
Where the hell is he?

2929
03:26:01,961 --> 03:26:03,128
Whoa!

2930
03:26:06,007 --> 03:26:07,508
Rock 'n' roll.

2931
03:26:15,809 --> 03:26:17,267
Yo. DOC: Marty, is that you?

2932
03:26:17,352 --> 03:26:19,394
Hey. Hey, Doc. Where are you?

2933
03:26:19,479 --> 03:26:20,646
Thank God I've found you.

2934
03:26:20,730 --> 03:26:23,148
Listen, can you meet me at
Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15?

2935
03:26:23,233 --> 03:26:24,983
I made a major breakthrough,
and I'll need your assistance.

2936
03:26:25,068 --> 03:26:26,276
Wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning?

2937
03:26:26,361 --> 03:26:27,361
Yeah.

2938
03:26:27,445 --> 03:26:29,112
Doc, what's going on?

2939
03:26:29,197 --> 03:26:31,156
Where you been all week? Working.

2940
03:26:31,241 --> 03:26:32,616
Where's Einstein? Is he with you?

2941
03:26:32,700 --> 03:26:34,409
Yeah, he's right here.

2942
03:26:34,494 --> 03:26:37,120
You know, Doc, you left
your equipment on all week.

2943
03:26:37,205 --> 03:26:39,790
My equipment. That reminds me, Marty.

2944
03:26:39,874 --> 03:26:41,333
You better not hook up to the amplifier.

2945
03:26:41,417 --> 03:26:43,710
There's a slight
possibility of overload.

2946
03:26:43,795 --> 03:26:46,171
Yeah. I'll keep that in mind.

2947
03:26:46,256 --> 03:26:48,674
Good. I'll see you
tonight. Don't forget now.

2948
03:26:48,758 --> 03:26:50,551
1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall.

2949
03:26:50,635 --> 03:26:51,677
Right.

2950
03:26:58,434 --> 03:27:00,185
Are those my clocks I hear?

2951
03:27:00,270 --> 03:27:02,938
Yeah, it's 8:00.

2952
03:27:03,356 --> 03:27:05,524
Perfect! My experiment worked!

2953
03:27:05,608 --> 03:27:08,110
They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!

2954
03:27:09,112 --> 03:27:11,113
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc.

2955
03:27:11,698 --> 03:27:13,866
Are you telling me that it's 8:25?

2956
03:27:13,950 --> 03:27:15,075
Precisely.

2957
03:27:15,618 --> 03:27:18,537
Damn! I'm late for school.

2958
03:28:18,598 --> 03:28:20,349
Jennifer. Marty, don't go this way.

2959
03:28:20,433 --> 03:28:21,433
Strickland's looking for you.

2960
03:28:21,517 --> 03:28:23,852
If you get caught, it'll
be four tardies in a row.

2961
03:28:25,855 --> 03:28:28,148
All right, come on. I think we're safe.

2962
03:28:28,232 --> 03:28:30,359
You know, this time it wasn't my fault.

2963
03:28:30,443 --> 03:28:32,778
The doc set all his
clocks 25 minutes slow.

2964
03:28:32,862 --> 03:28:34,112
Doc?

2965
03:28:34,197 --> 03:28:37,574
Am I to understand you're still hanging
around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?

2966
03:28:39,077 --> 03:28:41,161
Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker.

2967
03:28:41,913 --> 03:28:45,540
And one for you, McFly. I
believe that makes four in a row.

2968
03:28:45,625 --> 03:28:48,585
Let me give you a nickel's
worth of free advice, young man.

2969
03:28:48,670 --> 03:28:51,838
This so-called Dr. Brown is
dangerous. He's a real nutcase.

2970
03:28:51,923 --> 03:28:54,341
You hang around with him, you're
gonna end up in big trouble.

2971
03:28:54,425 --> 03:28:55,717
Ooh. Yes, sir.

2972
03:28:56,427 --> 03:29:00,013
You got a real attitude
problem, McFly. You're a slacker.

2973
03:29:00,264 --> 03:29:01,932
You remind me of your
father when he went here.

2974
03:29:02,016 --> 03:29:04,393
He was a slacker, too.

2975
03:29:04,477 --> 03:29:06,561
Can I go now, Mr. Strickland?

2976
03:29:06,646 --> 03:29:08,313
I noticed your band is on the roster

2977
03:29:08,398 --> 03:29:10,399
for the dance auditions
after school today.

2978
03:29:10,483 --> 03:29:12,901
Why even bother, McFly?
You don't have a chance.

2979
03:29:12,986 --> 03:29:14,778
You're too much like your old man.

2980
03:29:14,862 --> 03:29:17,114
No McFly ever amounted to anything

2981
03:29:17,198 --> 03:29:18,907
in the history of Hill Valley.

2982
03:29:20,868 --> 03:29:23,036
Yeah, well, history is gonna change.

2983
03:29:25,164 --> 03:29:26,623
Next, please.

2984
03:29:31,921 --> 03:29:33,588
Okay, guys, let's rock 'n roll.

2985
03:29:35,883 --> 03:29:37,217
All right.

2986
03:29:38,052 --> 03:29:40,762
We're the... We're the Pinheads.

2987
03:29:42,390 --> 03:29:43,890
One, two, three.

2988
03:30:03,494 --> 03:30:06,580
Okay, that's enough. Thank you, fellas.

2989
03:30:07,331 --> 03:30:08,790
Hold it, fellas.

2990
03:30:09,208 --> 03:30:11,543
I'm afraid you're just too darn loud.

2991
03:30:12,295 --> 03:30:13,837
Next, please.

2992
03:30:16,007 --> 03:30:18,341
Bring up the next group, please.

2993
03:30:20,470 --> 03:30:23,221
Re-elect
Mayor "Goldie" Wilson.

2994
03:30:23,306 --> 03:30:25,307
Progress is his middle name.

2995
03:30:25,391 --> 03:30:27,476
"Too loud." I can't believe it.

2996
03:30:27,560 --> 03:30:30,187
I'm never gonna get a chance
to play in front of anybody.

2997
03:30:30,271 --> 03:30:32,647
Marty, one rejection
isn't the end of the world.

2998
03:30:32,732 --> 03:30:35,150
I just don't think
I'm cut out for music.

2999
03:30:35,234 --> 03:30:37,194
But you're good, Marty.
You're really good,

3000
03:30:37,278 --> 03:30:39,071
and this audition
tape of yours is great.

3001
03:30:39,155 --> 03:30:41,198
You've gotta send it in
to the record company.

3002
03:30:41,324 --> 03:30:43,075
It's like Doc's always
saying. Yeah, I know. I know.

3003
03:30:43,159 --> 03:30:44,201
"If you put your mind to it,

3004
03:30:44,285 --> 03:30:46,787
"you can accomplish anything."

3005
03:30:46,871 --> 03:30:48,872
That's good advice, Marty.

3006
03:30:48,956 --> 03:30:50,415
All right, okay, Jennifer.

3007
03:30:50,500 --> 03:30:52,459
What if I send in the tape
and they don't like it?

3008
03:30:52,543 --> 03:30:54,461
What if they say I'm no good?

3009
03:30:54,545 --> 03:30:56,838
What if they say, "Get out of
here, kid. You got no future"?

3010
03:30:56,923 --> 03:31:00,133
I mean, I just don't think I
can take that kind of rejection.

3011
03:31:00,218 --> 03:31:02,219
Jesus, I'm starting to
sound like my old man.

3012
03:31:02,303 --> 03:31:04,054
Come on. He's not that
bad. Save the clock tower.

3013
03:31:04,138 --> 03:31:07,682
At least he's letting you
borrow the car tomorrow night.

3014
03:31:08,351 --> 03:31:10,268
Check out that 4x4.

3015
03:31:10,770 --> 03:31:12,270
That is hot.

3016
03:31:12,355 --> 03:31:13,605
Okay. Back her up.

3017
03:31:13,689 --> 03:31:16,942
Someday, Jennifer. Someday.

3018
03:31:17,401 --> 03:31:20,904
Wouldn't it be great to take
that truck up to the lake?

3019
03:31:21,906 --> 03:31:24,908
Throw a couple of
sleeping bags in the back.

3020
03:31:26,244 --> 03:31:28,203
Lie out underneath the stars.

3021
03:31:28,287 --> 03:31:30,122
Stop it. What?

3022
03:31:30,957 --> 03:31:33,583
Does your mom know?
About tomorrow night?

3023
03:31:33,668 --> 03:31:34,876
No, get out of town.

3024
03:31:34,961 --> 03:31:37,712
My mom thinks I'm going
camping with the guys.

3025
03:31:37,797 --> 03:31:39,381
Jennifer, my mother would freak out

3026
03:31:39,465 --> 03:31:40,799
if she knew I was
going up there with you,

3027
03:31:40,883 --> 03:31:43,051
and I'd get the standard lecture about

3028
03:31:43,136 --> 03:31:45,512
how she never did that kind
of stuff when she was a kid.

3029
03:31:45,596 --> 03:31:48,473
I mean, look, I think
the woman was born a nun.

3030
03:31:48,558 --> 03:31:51,059
She's just trying to
keep you respectable.

3031
03:31:51,144 --> 03:31:53,311
Well, she's not doing a very good job.

3032
03:31:53,396 --> 03:31:54,604
Terrible.

3033
03:31:54,689 --> 03:31:58,358
Save the clock tower.
Save the clock tower.

3034
03:31:58,442 --> 03:32:02,487
Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an
initiative to replace that clock.

3035
03:32:02,572 --> 03:32:05,157
Thirty years ago, lightning
struck that clock tower

3036
03:32:05,241 --> 03:32:06,992
and the clock hasn't run since.

3037
03:32:07,076 --> 03:32:09,369
We at the Hill Valley
Preservation Society

3038
03:32:09,453 --> 03:32:11,872
think it should be preserved
exactly the way it is

3039
03:32:11,956 --> 03:32:13,707
as part of our history and heritage.

3040
03:32:13,791 --> 03:32:14,833
There you go, lady. There's a quarter.

3041
03:32:14,917 --> 03:32:15,959
Thank you.

3042
03:32:16,043 --> 03:32:17,085
Don't forget to take a flyer.

3043
03:32:17,170 --> 03:32:18,170
Right.

3044
03:32:18,254 --> 03:32:20,172
Save the clock tower!

3045
03:32:21,841 --> 03:32:23,425
Where were we?

3046
03:32:23,926 --> 03:32:25,010
Right about here.

3047
03:32:25,094 --> 03:32:26,178
Jennifer!

3048
03:32:29,265 --> 03:32:31,641
It's my dad. I've got to go. Right.

3049
03:32:31,726 --> 03:32:33,185
I'll call you tonight.

3050
03:32:33,269 --> 03:32:34,394
I'll be at my grandma's.

3051
03:32:34,478 --> 03:32:36,897
Here, let me give you the number.

3052
03:32:41,903 --> 03:32:42,944
Bye.

3053
03:33:26,155 --> 03:33:29,157
Bravo,
Tango, Delta 6-2-9.

3054
03:33:29,242 --> 03:33:32,327
Tow for impoundment.
Any unit, please respond.

3055
03:33:34,747 --> 03:33:37,332
Perfect. Just perfect.

3056
03:33:43,798 --> 03:33:45,966
I can't believe you'd loan me your car

3057
03:33:46,050 --> 03:33:47,884
without telling me it had a blind spot.

3058
03:33:47,969 --> 03:33:49,552
Blind spot? I could've been killed.

3059
03:33:49,929 --> 03:33:52,264
Now, Biff, now, I never noticed

3060
03:33:52,348 --> 03:33:56,351
that the car had any blind spot
before when I would drive it.

3061
03:33:56,435 --> 03:33:57,852
Hi, Son.

3062
03:33:57,937 --> 03:34:00,146
What, are you
blind, McFly? It's there.

3063
03:34:00,231 --> 03:34:02,107
How else do you explain
that wreck out there?

3064
03:34:02,191 --> 03:34:05,193
Biff, can I assume

3065
03:34:05,611 --> 03:34:08,655
that your insurance is
going to pay for the damage?

3066
03:34:08,739 --> 03:34:11,032
My insurance? It's your car.

3067
03:34:11,117 --> 03:34:12,325
Your insurance should pay for it.

3068
03:34:12,410 --> 03:34:13,952
I wanna know who's
going to pay for this?

3069
03:34:14,036 --> 03:34:15,912
I spilled beer all over it
when the car smashed into me.

3070
03:34:15,997 --> 03:34:17,080
Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?

3071
03:34:17,164 --> 03:34:18,164
Ah...

3072
03:34:18,249 --> 03:34:20,208
And where's my reports?

3073
03:34:20,293 --> 03:34:21,793
Well, I haven't finished those up yet,

3074
03:34:21,877 --> 03:34:24,546
but I figured since
they weren't due till...

3075
03:34:24,630 --> 03:34:27,549
Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh?

3076
03:34:28,259 --> 03:34:30,552
Think, McFly. Think! All right.

3077
03:34:30,636 --> 03:34:32,721
I got to have time to get them retyped.

3078
03:34:32,805 --> 03:34:34,055
Do you realize what would happen

3079
03:34:34,140 --> 03:34:36,933
if I hand in my reports
in your handwriting?

3080
03:34:37,018 --> 03:34:38,560
I'll get fired.

3081
03:34:38,644 --> 03:34:41,438
You wouldn't want that
to happen, would you?

3082
03:34:41,522 --> 03:34:43,440
Would you? Of course not, Biff.

3083
03:34:43,524 --> 03:34:45,984
Now, I wouldn't want that to happen.

3084
03:34:46,068 --> 03:34:48,903
Now, look. I'll finish
those reports on up tonight,

3085
03:34:48,988 --> 03:34:51,823
and I'll run them on over
first thing tomorrow, all right?

3086
03:34:51,907 --> 03:34:53,742
Not too early. I sleep in Saturday.

3087
03:34:53,826 --> 03:34:55,076
McFly, your shoe's untied.

3088
03:34:55,161 --> 03:34:56,161
Oh.

3089
03:34:56,245 --> 03:34:58,621
Don't be so gullible, McFly.

3090
03:34:58,706 --> 03:35:00,582
Got the place fixed
up nice, though, McFly.

3091
03:35:02,877 --> 03:35:04,919
I have your car towed
all the way to your house

3092
03:35:05,004 --> 03:35:06,671
and all you got for me is lite beer?

3093
03:35:14,638 --> 03:35:17,098
What are you looking at, butthead?

3094
03:35:19,101 --> 03:35:21,144
Say hi to your mom for me.

3095
03:35:23,939 --> 03:35:25,940
I know what you're going to say, Son,

3096
03:35:26,025 --> 03:35:28,651
and you're right. You're right.

3097
03:35:29,820 --> 03:35:33,740
But Biff just happens
to be my supervisor,

3098
03:35:35,034 --> 03:35:38,453
And I'm afraid I'm just not
very good at confrontations.

3099
03:35:39,538 --> 03:35:41,331
But the car, Dad.

3100
03:35:43,125 --> 03:35:45,794
I mean, he wrecked it. He totaled it.

3101
03:35:46,712 --> 03:35:48,797
I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad.

3102
03:35:48,881 --> 03:35:51,049
Do you have any idea how
important this was to me?

3103
03:35:51,133 --> 03:35:52,175
Do you have any clue?

3104
03:35:52,259 --> 03:35:54,928
I know, and all I can say is, I'm...

3105
03:35:55,471 --> 03:35:56,930
I'm sorry.

3106
03:35:57,223 --> 03:35:59,599
Believe me, Marty, you're better off

3107
03:35:59,683 --> 03:36:02,602
without having to worry
about all the aggravation

3108
03:36:02,686 --> 03:36:05,939
and headaches of playing at that dance.

3109
03:36:06,023 --> 03:36:07,690
He's absolutely right, Marty.

3110
03:36:07,775 --> 03:36:10,276
The last thing you need is headaches.

3111
03:36:18,119 --> 03:36:21,746
Kids, we're going to have to
eat this cake by ourselves.

3112
03:36:22,331 --> 03:36:24,707
Your Uncle Joey didn't
make parole again.

3113
03:36:27,086 --> 03:36:30,422
I think it would be nice if
you all dropped him a line.

3114
03:36:30,506 --> 03:36:32,257
Uncle "Jailbird" Joey?

3115
03:36:32,341 --> 03:36:33,800
He's your brother, Mom.

3116
03:36:33,884 --> 03:36:37,720
Yeah. I think it's a major
embarrassment, having an uncle in prison.

3117
03:36:38,139 --> 03:36:40,014
We all make mistakes in life, children.

3118
03:36:40,099 --> 03:36:41,808
God damn it. I'm late.

3119
03:36:41,892 --> 03:36:43,560
David, watch your mouth!

3120
03:36:43,644 --> 03:36:46,229
You come here and kiss your
mother before you go. Come here.

3121
03:36:46,313 --> 03:36:49,399
Come on, Mom. Make it
fast. I'll miss my bus.

3122
03:36:49,859 --> 03:36:51,359
See you later, Pop.

3123
03:36:51,444 --> 03:36:54,195
Time to change that oil.

3124
03:36:57,324 --> 03:37:00,869
Hey, Marty. I'm not
your answering service.

3125
03:37:00,953 --> 03:37:03,371
While you were outside
pouting over the car,

3126
03:37:03,456 --> 03:37:05,707
Jennifer Parker called you twice.

3127
03:37:05,791 --> 03:37:07,208
I don't like her, Marty.

3128
03:37:07,293 --> 03:37:10,420
Any girl who calls up a boy
is just asking for trouble.

3129
03:37:10,504 --> 03:37:13,381
Oh, Mother, there's nothing
wrong with calling a boy.

3130
03:37:13,466 --> 03:37:16,968
I think it's terrible.
Girls chasing boys.

3131
03:37:17,386 --> 03:37:20,722
When I was your age, I never
chased a boy or called a boy

3132
03:37:20,806 --> 03:37:23,349
or sat in a parked car with a boy.

3133
03:37:24,018 --> 03:37:26,895
Then how am I supposed
to ever meet anybody?

3134
03:37:27,563 --> 03:37:30,023
Well, it'll just happen.

3135
03:37:30,107 --> 03:37:31,608
Like the way I met your father.

3136
03:37:32,485 --> 03:37:35,403
That was so stupid. Grandpa
hit him with the car.

3137
03:37:35,905 --> 03:37:37,655
It was meant to be.

3138
03:37:38,532 --> 03:37:42,035
Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him,

3139
03:37:42,119 --> 03:37:43,786
then none of you would have been born.

3140
03:37:43,871 --> 03:37:45,163
Yeah, well.

3141
03:37:45,748 --> 03:37:47,499
I still don't understand
what Dad was doing

3142
03:37:47,583 --> 03:37:49,000
in the middle of the street.

3143
03:37:49,084 --> 03:37:51,544
What was it, George? Bird-watching?

3144
03:37:51,629 --> 03:37:53,755
What, Lorraine? What?

3145
03:37:54,256 --> 03:37:57,175
Anyway, your Grandpa
hit him with the car

3146
03:37:57,259 --> 03:37:58,968
and brought him into the house.

3147
03:38:00,346 --> 03:38:02,263
He seemed so helpless,

3148
03:38:05,017 --> 03:38:08,019
like a little lost puppy, and
my heart just went out to him.

3149
03:38:08,103 --> 03:38:11,272
Yeah, Mom, we know. You've
told us this story a million times.

3150
03:38:11,357 --> 03:38:12,690
You felt sorry for him,

3151
03:38:12,775 --> 03:38:14,234
so you decided to go with him

3152
03:38:14,318 --> 03:38:15,860
to the Fish Under the Sea dance.

3153
03:38:15,945 --> 03:38:19,113
No. It was the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance.

3154
03:38:19,949 --> 03:38:23,076
Our first date. I'll never forget it.

3155
03:38:23,536 --> 03:38:26,204
It was the night of that terrible
thunderstorm, remember, George?

3156
03:38:29,875 --> 03:38:33,795
Your father kissed me for the very
first time on that dance floor.

3157
03:38:35,714 --> 03:38:37,882
It was then that I realized

3158
03:38:37,967 --> 03:38:40,843
that I was going to spend
the rest of my life with him.

3159
03:39:09,873 --> 03:39:10,915
Hello.

3160
03:39:11,000 --> 03:39:12,458
Marty, you didn't
fall asleep, did you?

3161
03:39:12,543 --> 03:39:14,002
Doc.

3162
03:39:15,045 --> 03:39:17,463
No. No, don't be silly.

3163
03:39:17,840 --> 03:39:20,800
Listen, this is very important.
I forgot my video camera.

3164
03:39:20,884 --> 03:39:23,720
Can you stop by my place and pick
it up on your way to the mall?

3165
03:39:23,804 --> 03:39:26,556
Yeah. I'm on my way.

3166
03:39:50,748 --> 03:39:52,957
Einstein! Hey, Einstein,
where's the doc, boy? Huh?

3167
03:40:48,097 --> 03:40:49,222
Doc!

3168
03:40:50,516 --> 03:40:51,849
Marty! You made it!

3169
03:40:51,934 --> 03:40:52,975
Yeah.

3170
03:40:53,060 --> 03:40:55,144
Welcome to my latest
experiment. This is the big one,

3171
03:40:55,229 --> 03:40:57,105
the one I've been
waiting for all my life.

3172
03:40:57,189 --> 03:40:58,648
Well, it's a DeLorean...

3173
03:40:58,732 --> 03:41:00,566
Bear with me, Marty. All your
questions will be answered.

3174
03:41:00,651 --> 03:41:01,984
Roll tape and we'll proceed.

3175
03:41:02,069 --> 03:41:03,111
Doc,

3176
03:41:03,195 --> 03:41:04,195
is that a DEVO suit?

3177
03:41:04,279 --> 03:41:05,571
Never mind that now.

3178
03:41:05,656 --> 03:41:06,739
Not now.

3179
03:41:06,824 --> 03:41:07,865
All right. I'm ready.

3180
03:41:08,492 --> 03:41:10,201
Good evening. I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.

3181
03:41:10,285 --> 03:41:12,453
I'm standing on the parking
lot at Twin Pines Mall.

3182
03:41:12,538 --> 03:41:16,124
It's Saturday morning,
October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m.,

3183
03:41:16,208 --> 03:41:18,459
and this is temporal
experiment number one.

3184
03:41:18,544 --> 03:41:20,586
Come on, Einie. Hey,
hey, boy, get in there.

3185
03:41:20,671 --> 03:41:22,964
That a boy! In you go. Sit down.

3186
03:41:23,924 --> 03:41:25,425
Put your seat belt on. That's it.

3187
03:41:30,556 --> 03:41:31,597
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

3188
03:41:31,682 --> 03:41:33,057
Okay.

3189
03:41:34,393 --> 03:41:37,019
Please note that Einstein's clock

3190
03:41:37,104 --> 03:41:40,022
is in precise synchronization
with my control watch.

3191
03:41:40,149 --> 03:41:41,691
Got it? Right. Check, Doc.

3192
03:41:41,775 --> 03:41:42,775
Good.

3193
03:41:44,945 --> 03:41:47,905
Have a good trip,
Einstein. Watch your head.

3194
03:41:53,579 --> 03:41:54,912
You got that thing hooked up to the car?

3195
03:41:56,165 --> 03:41:57,165
Watch this.

3196
03:41:57,249 --> 03:41:59,542
Yeah. Okay. Got it.

3197
03:42:03,672 --> 03:42:04,839
Jesus!

3198
03:42:09,720 --> 03:42:11,387
Not me! The car! The car!

3199
03:42:28,739 --> 03:42:31,032
If my calculations are correct,

3200
03:42:31,575 --> 03:42:34,202
when this baby hits 88 miles per hour

3201
03:42:34,661 --> 03:42:36,704
you're going to see some serious shit.

3202
03:43:12,699 --> 03:43:14,408
Watch this. Watch this.

3203
03:43:32,511 --> 03:43:34,846
What did I tell you?

3204
03:43:34,930 --> 03:43:38,391
88 miles per hour!

3205
03:43:41,478 --> 03:43:42,979
The temporal displacement occurred

3206
03:43:43,063 --> 03:43:46,399
exactly 1:20 a.m. And zero seconds!

3207
03:43:48,151 --> 03:43:50,027
Jesus Christ!

3208
03:43:50,112 --> 03:43:52,530
Jesus Christ, Doc! You
disintegrated Einstein!

3209
03:43:52,614 --> 03:43:55,241
Calm down, Marty. I didn't
disintegrate anything.

3210
03:43:55,325 --> 03:44:00,037
The molecular structure of both Einstein
and the car are completely intact.

3211
03:44:00,122 --> 03:44:01,497
Then where the hell are they?

3212
03:44:01,582 --> 03:44:03,082
The appropriate question is,

3213
03:44:03,166 --> 03:44:04,709
"When the hell are they?"

3214
03:44:04,793 --> 03:44:09,255
You see, Einstein has just become
the world's first time traveler.

3215
03:44:09,756 --> 03:44:12,675
I sent him into the future.

3216
03:44:13,427 --> 03:44:15,803
One minute into the future, to be exact.

3217
03:44:15,888 --> 03:44:19,098
At precisely 1:21 a.m. And zero seconds,

3218
03:44:19,182 --> 03:44:22,059
we shall catch up with
him and the time machine.

3219
03:44:25,606 --> 03:44:27,607
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc.

3220
03:44:29,276 --> 03:44:32,153
Are you telling me that
you built a time machine

3221
03:44:33,363 --> 03:44:34,488
out of a DeLorean?

3222
03:44:34,573 --> 03:44:35,615
The way I see it,

3223
03:44:35,699 --> 03:44:37,575
if you're going to build
a time machine into a car,

3224
03:44:37,659 --> 03:44:39,493
why not do it with some style?

3225
03:44:39,578 --> 03:44:42,747
Besides, the stainless-steel
construction made the flux dispersal...

3226
03:44:44,374 --> 03:44:45,791
Look out!

3227
03:45:30,671 --> 03:45:31,796
What? Is it hot?

3228
03:45:31,880 --> 03:45:33,589
It's cold. Damn cold.

3229
03:45:37,302 --> 03:45:39,220
Einstein, you little devil!

3230
03:45:41,723 --> 03:45:43,516
Einstein's clock is exactly one minute

3231
03:45:43,600 --> 03:45:45,977
behind mine and still ticking!

3232
03:45:49,481 --> 03:45:50,690
He's all right. He's fine.

3233
03:45:50,774 --> 03:45:53,109
And he's completely unaware
that anything happened.

3234
03:45:53,193 --> 03:45:55,820
As far as he's concerned,
the trip was instantaneous.

3235
03:45:55,904 --> 03:45:58,489
That's why his watch is
exactly one minute behind mine.

3236
03:45:58,573 --> 03:45:59,657
He skipped over that minute

3237
03:45:59,741 --> 03:46:01,617
to instantly arrive
at this moment in time.

3238
03:46:01,702 --> 03:46:03,536
Come here. I'll show you how it works.

3239
03:46:03,620 --> 03:46:04,745
All right.

3240
03:46:06,415 --> 03:46:09,166
First, you turn the time circuits on.

3241
03:46:13,213 --> 03:46:14,547
This readout tells
you where you're going.

3242
03:46:14,631 --> 03:46:15,840
This one tells you where you are.

3243
03:46:15,924 --> 03:46:17,425
This one tells you where you were.

3244
03:46:17,509 --> 03:46:19,844
You input your destination
time on this keypad.

3245
03:46:19,928 --> 03:46:21,178
Say you want to see the signing

3246
03:46:21,263 --> 03:46:23,806
of the Declaration of Independence.

3247
03:46:25,600 --> 03:46:27,893
Or witness the birth of Christ.

3248
03:46:30,689 --> 03:46:33,315
Here's a red-letter date
in the history of science.

3249
03:46:33,400 --> 03:46:36,110
November 5th, 1955.

3250
03:46:39,948 --> 03:46:44,201
Yes, of course. November 5th, 1955.

3251
03:46:45,162 --> 03:46:46,787
What? I don't get it. What happened?

3252
03:46:48,040 --> 03:46:51,834
That was the day I invented time
travel. I remember it vividly.

3253
03:46:52,461 --> 03:46:54,503
I was standing on the edge
of my toilet, hanging a clock.

3254
03:46:54,588 --> 03:46:55,713
The porcelain was wet. I slipped,

3255
03:46:55,797 --> 03:46:57,339
hit my head on the edge of the sink,

3256
03:46:57,424 --> 03:46:59,467
and when I came to, I had a revelation,

3257
03:46:59,551 --> 03:47:02,887
a vision, a picture in my
head, a picture of this.

3258
03:47:03,680 --> 03:47:08,309
This is what makes time travel
possible. The flux capacitor.

3259
03:47:08,977 --> 03:47:10,186
Flux capacitor?

3260
03:47:10,270 --> 03:47:12,730
It's taken me almost 30 years
and my entire family fortune

3261
03:47:12,814 --> 03:47:15,232
to realize the vision of that day.

3262
03:47:15,317 --> 03:47:17,568
My God, has it been that long?

3263
03:47:18,236 --> 03:47:21,072
Things have certainly
changed around here.

3264
03:47:22,032 --> 03:47:23,908
I remember when this was all farmland

3265
03:47:23,992 --> 03:47:26,118
as far as the eye could see.

3266
03:47:27,370 --> 03:47:29,830
Old man Peabody owned all of this.

3267
03:47:31,083 --> 03:47:34,668
He had this crazy idea
about breeding pine trees.

3268
03:47:38,799 --> 03:47:42,259
This is heavy-duty, Doc. This is great.

3269
03:47:42,719 --> 03:47:45,262
Does it run on regular
unleaded gasoline?

3270
03:47:45,347 --> 03:47:46,931
Unfortunately, no. It requires something

3271
03:47:47,015 --> 03:47:49,141
with a little more kick. Plutonium.

3272
03:47:49,601 --> 03:47:51,477
Plutonium. Wait a minute.

3273
03:47:51,561 --> 03:47:53,938
Are you telling me that
this sucker is nuclear?

3274
03:47:54,022 --> 03:47:56,023
Hey, hey, hey! Keep
rolling. Keep rolling there.

3275
03:47:56,108 --> 03:47:57,942
No, no, no, this sucker's electrical,

3276
03:47:58,026 --> 03:47:59,235
but I need a nuclear reaction

3277
03:47:59,319 --> 03:48:01,779
to generate the 1.21 gigawatts
of electricity I need.

3278
03:48:01,863 --> 03:48:05,449
Doc, you don't just walk into
a store and buy plutonium.

3279
03:48:06,034 --> 03:48:07,701
Did you rip that off?

3280
03:48:09,830 --> 03:48:12,456
Of course. From a group
of Libyan nationalists.

3281
03:48:12,541 --> 03:48:13,749
They wanted me to build them a bomb,

3282
03:48:13,834 --> 03:48:16,293
so I took their plutonium and, in
turn, gave them a shoddy bomb casing

3283
03:48:16,378 --> 03:48:18,087
full of used pinball machine parts.

3284
03:48:18,213 --> 03:48:20,131
Come on. Let's get you
a radiation suit. Jesus!

3285
03:48:20,215 --> 03:48:21,590
We must prepare to reload.

3286
03:48:50,745 --> 03:48:53,205
It's safe now. Everything's lead-lined.

3287
03:48:55,125 --> 03:48:57,251
Don't you lose those tapes now.

3288
03:48:57,335 --> 03:48:58,752
I need that as a record.

3289
03:48:59,337 --> 03:49:01,714
Let's put this back here. There we go.

3290
03:49:04,050 --> 03:49:05,843
I almost forgot my luggage.

3291
03:49:05,927 --> 03:49:08,679
Who knows if they've got
cotton underwear in the future?

3292
03:49:08,763 --> 03:49:10,055
I'm allergic to all synthetics.

3293
03:49:10,140 --> 03:49:11,765
The future?

3294
03:49:12,559 --> 03:49:13,559
That's where you're going?

3295
03:49:13,643 --> 03:49:15,186
That's right, 25 years into the future.

3296
03:49:15,270 --> 03:49:18,314
I've always dreamed of seeing the
future, looking beyond my years,

3297
03:49:18,398 --> 03:49:20,524
seeing the progress of mankind.

3298
03:49:20,609 --> 03:49:21,817
Why not?

3299
03:49:21,902 --> 03:49:25,696
I'll also be able to see who
wins the next 25 World Series.

3300
03:49:26,072 --> 03:49:27,198
Doc.

3301
03:49:27,282 --> 03:49:28,324
Huh?

3302
03:49:28,491 --> 03:49:30,910
Look me up when you get there.

3303
03:49:31,620 --> 03:49:34,163
Indeed, I will. Roll 'em.

3304
03:49:40,503 --> 03:49:42,963
I, Dr. Emmett Brown,

3305
03:49:44,549 --> 03:49:47,426
am about to embark on
an historic journey.

3306
03:49:49,346 --> 03:49:50,888
What am I thinking of?

3307
03:49:50,972 --> 03:49:53,474
I almost forgot to
bring extra plutonium.

3308
03:49:53,558 --> 03:49:56,101
How did I ever expect to get
back? One pellet, one trip.

3309
03:49:56,186 --> 03:49:57,811
I must be out of my mind.

3310
03:50:00,774 --> 03:50:02,441
What is it, Einie?

3311
03:50:10,909 --> 03:50:12,451
Oh, my God.

3312
03:50:12,535 --> 03:50:15,329
They found me. I don't
know how, but they found me.

3313
03:50:15,413 --> 03:50:16,497
Run for it, Marty!

3314
03:50:16,581 --> 03:50:17,623
Who? Who?

3315
03:50:18,083 --> 03:50:20,501
Who do you think? The Libyans!

3316
03:50:23,797 --> 03:50:25,297
Holy shit!

3317
03:50:29,344 --> 03:50:31,178
I'll draw their fire!

3318
03:50:39,145 --> 03:50:40,187
Doc, wait!

3319
03:50:54,786 --> 03:50:55,869
No!

3320
03:50:57,080 --> 03:50:58,664
You bastard!

3321
03:51:17,517 --> 03:51:18,809
Go! Damn Soviet gun.

3322
03:51:24,816 --> 03:51:25,858
Go!

3323
03:52:06,733 --> 03:52:09,068
Come on! Move, damn it!

3324
03:52:10,487 --> 03:52:11,820
Jesus!

3325
03:52:31,966 --> 03:52:33,425
Holy shit!

3326
03:52:34,177 --> 03:52:36,887
Let's see if you bastards can do 90.

3327
03:53:40,200 --> 03:53:42,284
Crazy drunk driver.

3328
03:53:52,796 --> 03:53:54,213
Whoo!

3329
03:53:57,425 --> 03:53:59,677
All right. Fred.

3330
03:54:01,179 --> 03:54:03,973
You look great. Everything looks great.

3331
03:54:05,225 --> 03:54:09,228
1:24. I still got time. I'm coming, Doc!

3332
03:54:12,899 --> 03:54:17,653
No! No, not again! Come on! Come on!

3333
03:54:31,418 --> 03:54:32,751
Libyans.

3334
03:54:55,400 --> 03:54:56,442
No!

3335
03:54:57,777 --> 03:54:59,278
You bastard!

3336
03:55:12,626 --> 03:55:13,959
Go!

3337
03:55:48,328 --> 03:55:50,454
Doc! Doc!

3338
03:55:55,919 --> 03:55:58,087
No! No!

3339
03:56:13,019 --> 03:56:14,520
You're alive.

3340
03:56:23,738 --> 03:56:25,364
Bulletproof vest?

3341
03:56:26,700 --> 03:56:28,367
How did you know?

3342
03:56:29,160 --> 03:56:31,578
I never got a chance to tell you.

3343
03:56:45,135 --> 03:56:49,179
What about all that talk about
screwing up future events?

3344
03:56:49,264 --> 03:56:51,348
The space-time continuum?

3345
03:56:51,808 --> 03:56:54,727
Well, I figured, what the hell?

3346
03:57:04,946 --> 03:57:06,905
So, how far ahead are you going?

3347
03:57:06,990 --> 03:57:09,992
About 30 years. It's
a nice, round number.

3348
03:57:10,076 --> 03:57:14,538
Look me up when you get there,
all right? Guess I'll be about 47.

3349
03:57:14,622 --> 03:57:15,873
I will.

3350
03:57:16,291 --> 03:57:17,708
Take care.

3351
03:57:18,460 --> 03:57:19,668
You, too.

3352
03:57:19,753 --> 03:57:22,087
Right. Bye-bye, Einie.

3353
03:57:22,589 --> 03:57:25,591
Oh. And watch that re-entry.
It's a little bumpy.

3354
03:57:26,301 --> 03:57:27,593
You bet.

3355
03:58:32,575 --> 03:58:34,201
What a nightmare.

3356
03:58:45,547 --> 03:58:48,507
If Paul calls me, tell him I'm
working at the boutique late tonight.

3357
03:58:48,591 --> 03:58:50,676
Linda, first of all,
I'm not your answering service,

3358
03:58:50,760 --> 03:58:52,302
second of all, somebody named Greg

3359
03:58:52,387 --> 03:58:54,263
or Craig called you
just a little while ago.

3360
03:58:54,347 --> 03:58:55,931
Well, which one was it, Greg or Craig?

3361
03:58:56,015 --> 03:58:58,725
I don't know! I can't keep up
with all of your boyfriends.

3362
03:58:58,810 --> 03:58:59,935
Hey.

3363
03:59:00,979 --> 03:59:02,688
What the hell is this?

3364
03:59:03,440 --> 03:59:04,523
Breakfast.

3365
03:59:05,024 --> 03:59:07,443
Did you sleep in your
clothes again last night?

3366
03:59:07,527 --> 03:59:08,861
Yeah. I...

3367
03:59:09,863 --> 03:59:12,406
Yeah. What are you wearing, Dave?

3368
03:59:12,699 --> 03:59:15,534
Marty, I always wear
a suit to the office.

3369
03:59:17,245 --> 03:59:19,079
You all right? Yeah.

3370
03:59:19,873 --> 03:59:20,956
I think we
need a rematch, George.

3371
03:59:21,040 --> 03:59:22,082
A rematch?

3372
03:59:22,167 --> 03:59:23,208
Why? Were you cheating?

3373
03:59:23,293 --> 03:59:24,293
No.

3374
03:59:24,377 --> 03:59:26,253
Hello. Good morning.

3375
03:59:28,339 --> 03:59:29,840
Mom! Dad!

3376
03:59:30,216 --> 03:59:31,800
Did you hit your head?
Marty, are you all right?

3377
03:59:31,885 --> 03:59:35,888
You guys look great.
Mom, you look so thin.

3378
03:59:36,222 --> 03:59:38,765
Why, thank you, Marty. George!

3379
03:59:40,226 --> 03:59:42,311
Good morning, sleepyhead.

3380
03:59:43,229 --> 03:59:44,605
Good morning, Dave. Linda.

3381
03:59:44,689 --> 03:59:46,064
Good morning, Mom.

3382
03:59:46,149 --> 03:59:48,650
Marty, I almost
forgot. Jennifer Parker called.

3383
03:59:48,735 --> 03:59:52,362
I sure like her, Marty.
She is such a sweet girl.

3384
03:59:52,906 --> 03:59:54,907
Isn't tonight the night of the big date?

3385
03:59:54,991 --> 03:59:56,950
What? What, Ma?

3386
03:59:57,035 --> 03:59:58,410
Aren't you going up to the lake tonight?

3387
03:59:58,495 --> 04:00:01,163
You've been planning it for two weeks.

3388
04:00:01,247 --> 04:00:03,916
Mom, we talked about this.
How can I go to the lake?

3389
04:00:04,000 --> 04:00:05,125
The car's wrecked.

3390
04:00:05,210 --> 04:00:06,793
Wrecked? Wrecked?

3391
04:00:06,878 --> 04:00:08,003
When did this happen? Why wasn't I told?

3392
04:00:08,087 --> 04:00:09,087
Quiet down.

3393
04:00:09,172 --> 04:00:10,672
I'm sure the car is fine.

3394
04:00:10,757 --> 04:00:13,008
Why am I always the last
one to know about these things?

3395
04:00:13,092 --> 04:00:16,178
See? There's Biff out
there waxing it right now.

3396
04:00:16,596 --> 04:00:18,013
Now, Biff, I want to make sure that

3397
04:00:18,097 --> 04:00:20,933
we get two coats of wax
this time, not just one.

3398
04:00:21,017 --> 04:00:22,601
I'm just finishing up
the second coat now.

3399
04:00:22,685 --> 04:00:25,270
Now, Biff, don't con me.

3400
04:00:26,773 --> 04:00:28,815
I'm sorry, Mr. McFly.

3401
04:00:28,900 --> 04:00:31,985
I meant I was just
starting on the second coat.

3402
04:00:33,071 --> 04:00:36,907
Biff. What a character. Always
trying to get away with something.

3403
04:00:37,408 --> 04:00:40,369
I've had to stay on top of
Biff ever since high school.

3404
04:00:40,453 --> 04:00:42,538
Although, if it wasn't for him...

3405
04:00:42,622 --> 04:00:44,206
We never would have fallen in love.

3406
04:00:44,290 --> 04:00:45,749
That's right.

3407
04:00:46,292 --> 04:00:49,002
Mr. McFly! Mr. McFly, this just arrived.

3408
04:00:49,087 --> 04:00:51,880
Oh, hi, Marty. I think
it's your new book.

3409
04:00:54,467 --> 04:00:58,303
Honey! Your first novel.

3410
04:00:58,388 --> 04:00:59,429
Like I've always told you,

3411
04:00:59,514 --> 04:01:02,432
you put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything.

3412
04:01:02,517 --> 04:01:05,018
Oh, Marty, here's your keys.

3413
04:01:05,103 --> 04:01:06,895
You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.

3414
04:01:07,480 --> 04:01:08,647
Keys?

3415
04:01:21,800 --> 04:01:23,676
How about a ride,
mister?

3416
04:01:23,760 --> 04:01:24,844
Jennifer.

3417
04:01:27,347 --> 04:01:29,890
Oh, man, are you a sight
for sore eyes!

3418
04:01:30,976 --> 04:01:32,435
Let me look at you.

3419
04:01:32,519 --> 04:01:35,521
Marty, you're acting like
you haven't seen me in a week.

3420
04:01:36,189 --> 04:01:37,440
I haven't.

3421
04:01:37,524 --> 04:01:40,234
Are you okay?
Is everything all right?

3422
04:01:45,198 --> 04:01:46,407
Oh, yeah.

3423
04:01:47,451 --> 04:01:49,243
Everything's great.

3424
04:02:02,924 --> 04:02:06,594
Marty! You've got to come back with me!

3425
04:02:08,346 --> 04:02:09,430
Where?

3426
04:02:09,514 --> 04:02:10,556
Back to the future.

3427
04:02:14,853 --> 04:02:16,812
Wait a minute.
What are you doing, Doc?

3428
04:02:16,897 --> 04:02:17,897
I need fuel.

3429
04:02:20,150 --> 04:02:22,568
Go ahead. Quick!
Get in the car.

3430
04:02:23,904 --> 04:02:26,155
No, no, no. Look, Doc,
I just got here, okay?

3431
04:02:26,239 --> 04:02:28,616
Jennifer's here. We're gonna
take the new truck for a spin.

3432
04:02:28,700 --> 04:02:31,785
Well, bring her along.
This concerns her, too.

3433
04:02:31,870 --> 04:02:33,662
Wait a minute, Doc. What
are you talking about?

3434
04:02:33,747 --> 04:02:35,498
What happens to us
in the future?

3435
04:02:35,582 --> 04:02:38,167
What, do we become assholes
or something?

3436
04:02:38,251 --> 04:02:40,836
No, no, no. You and
Jennifer both turn out fine.

3437
04:02:40,921 --> 04:02:41,962
It's your kids, Marty.

3438
04:02:42,047 --> 04:02:44,131
Something has got to
be done about your kids.

3439
04:02:51,097 --> 04:02:54,517
Hey, Doc, we better back up. We don't
have enough road to get up to 88.

3440
04:02:54,601 --> 04:02:59,021
Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need roads.

3441
04:02:59,940 --> 04:03:01,482
Say, Marty!

3442
04:03:01,566 --> 04:03:04,652
Marty! Marty, I wanted to
show you these new matchbooks

3443
04:03:04,736 --> 04:03:06,862
for my auto detailing
I had printed up.

3444
04:03:10,742 --> 04:03:12,284
A flying DeLorean?

3445
04:03:25,048 --> 04:03:27,424
What the hell
is going on here?

3446
04:03:47,000 --> 04:03:48,626
Did we make it?

3447
04:03:52,547 --> 04:03:53,923
Are we back?

3448
04:04:00,764 --> 04:04:01,805
We're back.

3449
04:04:22,702 --> 04:04:24,078
Let's put her
in the swing.

3450
04:04:24,162 --> 04:04:25,454
Then I'll take you home,
and you can come back

3451
04:04:25,538 --> 04:04:27,456
in your truck
and wake her.

3452
04:04:27,540 --> 04:04:30,000
When she awakens here in
her own house and it's dark,

3453
04:04:30,085 --> 04:04:32,836
you should be able to convince
her that it was all a dream.

3454
04:04:32,921 --> 04:04:34,088
Wait a minute.
We're just gonna

3455
04:04:34,172 --> 04:04:35,673
leave her here
on the porch?

3456
04:04:35,757 --> 04:04:39,009
The disorientation will help
convince her that it was all a dream.

3457
04:04:39,094 --> 04:04:40,970
How long do you think
she's gonna be out?

3458
04:04:41,054 --> 04:04:43,597
I'm not quite sure. She
received quite a shock.

3459
04:04:43,682 --> 04:04:44,890
Could be for
a few minutes.

3460
04:04:44,975 --> 04:04:47,309
Most probably,
a couple of hours.

3461
04:04:47,394 --> 04:04:49,103
You better bring smelling
salts back with you.

3462
04:04:49,187 --> 04:04:50,479
You're the doc, Doc.

3463
04:04:50,563 --> 04:04:51,605
All right. Come on.
Let's go, Einie.

3464
04:04:54,401 --> 04:04:56,443
Don't worry.
She'll be fine.

3465
04:04:57,529 --> 04:05:00,239
I don't remember bars
being on these windows.

3466
04:05:16,923 --> 04:05:20,009
If you need me, I'll be back at
my lab dismantling this thing.

3467
04:05:20,093 --> 04:05:21,302
Right.

3468
04:05:38,653 --> 04:05:40,321
What the hell?

3469
04:05:58,173 --> 04:05:59,882
Hey. Hey, wait.
Wait a minute.

3470
04:05:59,966 --> 04:06:01,675
What are
you doing in my room?

3471
04:06:01,760 --> 04:06:02,843
Help! Rape! Mom!

3472
04:06:02,927 --> 04:06:03,927
Okay. Okay.

3473
04:06:04,012 --> 04:06:05,512
Dad, help!

3474
04:06:05,597 --> 04:06:06,764
Freeze, sucker!

3475
04:06:06,890 --> 04:06:08,432
He jumped me! Hey, it's okay.
I don't want any trouble.

3476
04:06:08,516 --> 04:06:09,516
He came through
the window!

3477
04:06:09,601 --> 04:06:11,435
You got trouble now,
you piece of trash.

3478
04:06:12,103 --> 04:06:13,437
What are you doing in here
with my daughter?

3479
04:06:13,521 --> 04:06:14,897
Hey, listen, I'm just
in the wrong house.

3480
04:06:14,981 --> 04:06:17,441
You got that right,
you little son of a...

3481
04:06:17,942 --> 04:06:19,151
Hey, look,
I made a mistake.

3482
04:06:19,235 --> 04:06:21,945
Damn right you
made a mistake!

3483
04:06:22,030 --> 04:06:23,030
Kill him!

3484
04:06:23,114 --> 04:06:24,948
I'm gonna tear
your ass up!

3485
04:06:25,033 --> 04:06:27,159
That's right.
You keep running, sucker!

3486
04:06:27,243 --> 04:06:28,535
And you tell
that realty company

3487
04:06:28,620 --> 04:06:30,162
that I ain't selling!
You hear?

3488
04:06:30,246 --> 04:06:32,206
We ain't gonna
be terrorized!

3489
04:07:14,332 --> 04:07:16,750
This has gotta
be the wrong year.

3490
04:07:34,853 --> 04:07:36,228
1985?

3491
04:07:37,772 --> 04:07:38,814
It can't be.

3492
04:07:38,898 --> 04:07:39,898
Drop it.

3493
04:07:43,695 --> 04:07:46,447
So you're the son of a bitch
who's been stealing my newspapers.

3494
04:07:46,531 --> 04:07:47,906
Mr. Strickland.

3495
04:07:48,450 --> 04:07:50,909
Mr. Strickland. It's
me, sir. It's Marty.

3496
04:07:50,994 --> 04:07:51,994
Who?

3497
04:07:52,078 --> 04:07:53,287
It's Marty McFly.
Marty McFly.

3498
04:07:53,371 --> 04:07:54,955
Don't you know me, sir?
From school, sir.

3499
04:07:55,039 --> 04:07:56,290
I've never seen you
before in my life,

3500
04:07:56,374 --> 04:07:58,083
but you look to
me like a slacker.

3501
04:07:58,168 --> 04:08:00,461
Yeah, that's right. That's
right. I am a slacker.

3502
04:08:00,545 --> 04:08:02,629
Don't you remember? You
gave me detention last week.

3503
04:08:02,714 --> 04:08:05,466
Last week? The school
burned down six years ago.

3504
04:08:05,550 --> 04:08:06,633
Now, you got
exactly three seconds

3505
04:08:06,718 --> 04:08:08,302
to get off my porch
with your nuts intact.

3506
04:08:08,386 --> 04:08:10,304
One.
Please, Mr. Strickland,

3507
04:08:10,388 --> 04:08:11,847
I just want to know what
the hell's going on here.

3508
04:08:11,931 --> 04:08:12,931
Two.

3509
04:08:14,100 --> 04:08:15,142
Hey, Strickland!

3510
04:08:15,226 --> 04:08:16,226
Yeah!

3511
04:08:33,828 --> 04:08:35,579
Eat lead, slackers!

3512
04:08:42,670 --> 04:08:46,632
Watch where you're going,
crazy drunk pedestrian.

3513
04:08:47,091 --> 04:08:48,425
Red.

3514
04:09:44,774 --> 04:09:46,316
Ladies and gentlemen,

3515
04:09:46,401 --> 04:09:48,902

See Biff's

on his 21 st birthday made

Share in the excitement

How's it feel,
Mr. Tannen?

3543
04:11:05,563 --> 04:11:07,189
Third time's
the charm.

3544
04:11:09,984 --> 04:11:14,363
No! No!

3545
04:11:14,447 --> 04:11:15,697
Hey, you're coming
with us upstairs.

3546
04:11:15,782 --> 04:11:16,823
Let me go.

3547
04:11:16,908 --> 04:11:19,451
Look, sonny, we can do this
the easy way or the hard way.

3548
04:11:19,994 --> 04:11:21,745
The easy way.

3549
04:11:28,419 --> 04:11:31,505
Mom? Mom, is that you?

3550
04:11:31,589 --> 04:11:33,090
Just relax, Marty.

3551
04:11:33,966 --> 04:11:37,010
You've been asleep
for almost two hours.

3552
04:11:38,680 --> 04:11:41,932
I had a horrible nightmare.
It was terrible.

3553
04:11:42,392 --> 04:11:45,602
Well, you're safe
and sound now,

3554
04:11:45,687 --> 04:11:48,271
back on the good
old 27th floor.

3555
04:11:49,232 --> 04:11:51,149
Twenty-seventh floor!

3556
04:11:56,781 --> 04:11:59,574
Mom?
Mom, that can't be you.

3557
04:12:00,368 --> 04:12:03,370
Well, yes, it's me,
Marty. Are you all right?

3558
04:12:03,454 --> 04:12:07,374
I'm fine. I'm fine. It's just
that you're so... You're so

3559
04:12:08,376 --> 04:12:09,626
big.

3560
04:12:10,253 --> 04:12:12,713
Oh. Everything's gonna be
fine, Marty. Are you hungry?

3561
04:12:12,797 --> 04:12:14,423
I can call room service.

3562
04:12:16,467 --> 04:12:17,801
Room service?

3563
04:12:17,885 --> 04:12:19,553
Lorraine!

3564
04:12:19,637 --> 04:12:21,221
Oh, my God.
It's your father.

3565
04:12:21,305 --> 04:12:22,472
My father?

3566
04:12:24,559 --> 04:12:27,310
You're supposed to be in Switzerland,
you little son of a bitch!

3567
04:12:27,395 --> 04:12:28,562
My father!

3568
04:12:28,646 --> 04:12:30,605
Did you get kicked out
of another boarding school?

3569
04:12:30,690 --> 04:12:33,191
Damn it, Lorraine. Do you know
how much perfectly good dough

3570
04:12:33,276 --> 04:12:34,901
I've blown on this
no-good kid of yours, huh?

3571
04:12:34,986 --> 04:12:35,986
On all three of them?

3572
04:12:36,070 --> 04:12:39,156
What the hell do you
care? We can afford it.

3573
04:12:39,699 --> 04:12:41,408
The least we can do
with all that money

3574
04:12:41,492 --> 04:12:43,535
is provide a better life
for our children.

3575
04:12:43,619 --> 04:12:44,911
Hold on one second.

3576
04:12:44,996 --> 04:12:48,081
Let's get this straight.
Marty is your kid, not mine.

3577
04:12:48,166 --> 04:12:49,291
And all the money
in the world

3578
04:12:49,375 --> 04:12:51,209
wouldn't do jack shit
for that lazy bum.

3579
04:12:51,294 --> 04:12:53,420
Stop it, Biff.
Just stop it.

3580
04:12:53,504 --> 04:12:56,965
Look at him. He's a butthead,
just like his old man was.

3581
04:12:59,886 --> 04:13:03,513
Don't you dare speak
that way about George.

3582
04:13:05,099 --> 04:13:07,434
You're not even
half the man he was.

3583
04:13:09,312 --> 04:13:11,438
You son of a bitch!
Hey.

3584
04:13:16,110 --> 04:13:18,445
Always
the little hothead, huh?

3585
04:13:24,410 --> 04:13:26,536
You wanna
take a poke at me?

3586
04:13:29,957 --> 04:13:32,751
Damn it, Biff.
That's it. I'm leaving.

3587
04:13:33,920 --> 04:13:36,546
So go ahead. But think
about this, Lorraine!

3588
04:13:36,714 --> 04:13:38,632
Who's gonna pay for
all your clothes, huh?

3589
04:13:38,716 --> 04:13:40,550
And your jewelry
and your liquor?

3590
04:13:40,635 --> 04:13:43,804
Who's gonna pay for your
cosmetic surgery, Lorraine?

3591
04:13:43,888 --> 04:13:47,265
You were the one who wanted
me to get these things.

3592
04:13:47,892 --> 04:13:50,644
If you want them back,
you can have them.

3593
04:13:50,728 --> 04:13:53,021
Look, Lorraine.
You walk out that door,

3594
04:13:53,105 --> 04:13:56,149
and I won't only cut off
you. I'll cut off your kids.

3595
04:13:56,901 --> 04:13:57,943
You wouldn't.

3596
04:13:58,027 --> 04:13:58,985
Wouldn't I?

3597
04:13:59,070 --> 04:14:00,320
First your daughter,
Linda.

3598
04:14:00,404 --> 04:14:02,280
I'll cancel all
her credit cards.

3599
04:14:02,365 --> 04:14:04,866
She can settle her debts
with the bank all by herself.

3600
04:14:04,951 --> 04:14:08,078
Your idiot son, Dave. I'll
get his probation revoked.

3601
04:14:08,162 --> 04:14:10,247
And as for Marty.

3602
04:14:10,331 --> 04:14:13,166
Well, maybe you'd like to have
all three of your kids behind bars,

3603
04:14:13,251 --> 04:14:15,335
just like
your brother Joey.

3604
04:14:15,419 --> 04:14:18,088
One big, happy,
jailbird family.

3605
04:14:20,842 --> 04:14:24,427
All right, Biff.
You win. I'll stay.

3606
04:14:28,099 --> 04:14:32,018
As for you, I'll be back up here
in an hour, so you better not be.

3607
04:14:43,322 --> 04:14:45,907
He was right,
and I was wrong.

3608
04:14:48,286 --> 04:14:49,995
Mom!

3609
04:14:50,079 --> 04:14:51,162
Mom,
what are you saying?

3610
04:14:51,247 --> 04:14:52,956
You're actually
defending him.

3611
04:14:53,040 --> 04:14:55,500
I had it coming.
He's my husband,

3612
04:14:55,585 --> 04:14:57,502
and he takes care
of all of us,

3613
04:14:58,129 --> 04:14:59,838
and he deserves
our respect.

3614
04:14:59,922 --> 04:15:01,131
Respect?

3615
04:15:01,883 --> 04:15:05,635
Your husband! How could
he be your husband?

3616
04:15:06,178 --> 04:15:08,221
How could you
leave Dad for him?

3617
04:15:08,306 --> 04:15:09,556
Leave Dad?

3618
04:15:09,640 --> 04:15:11,683
Marty, are you
feeling all right?

3619
04:15:11,767 --> 04:15:14,227
No. No, I'm not
feeling all right!

3620
04:15:14,312 --> 04:15:16,855
I don't understand one damn
thing that's going on around here,

3621
04:15:16,939 --> 04:15:19,816
and why nobody can give me
a simple, straight answer.

3622
04:15:20,067 --> 04:15:22,944
Oh, they must have hit you
over the head hard this time.

3623
04:15:23,029 --> 04:15:26,114
Mom, I just want
to know one thing.

3624
04:15:26,198 --> 04:15:29,200
Where's my father?
Where's George McFly?

3625
04:15:30,661 --> 04:15:34,247
Marty, George,
your father

3626
04:15:34,332 --> 04:15:37,459
is in the same place he's
been for the past 12 years.

3627
04:15:39,837 --> 04:15:41,796
Oak Park Cemetery.

3628
04:16:07,531 --> 04:16:08,865
No.

3629
04:16:11,452 --> 04:16:14,204
No! This can't
be happening!

3630
04:16:15,289 --> 04:16:17,540
"March 15, 1973."

3631
04:16:17,625 --> 04:16:20,794
No! Please, God, no!

3632
04:16:22,254 --> 04:16:24,923
No, please, God.
Please, God, no.

3633
04:16:25,007 --> 04:16:28,343
This can't be happening.

3634
04:16:30,054 --> 04:16:31,554
This can't be...

3635
04:16:31,639 --> 04:16:34,099
I'm afraid it is
happening, Marty. All of it.

3636
04:16:34,558 --> 04:16:35,684
Doc!

3637
04:16:35,768 --> 04:16:37,102
When I learned
about your father,

3638
04:16:37,186 --> 04:16:38,645
I figured
you'd come here.

3639
04:16:41,190 --> 04:16:43,858
Then you know
what happened to him?

3640
04:16:45,361 --> 04:16:51,199
Do you know what
happened March 15, 1973?

3641
04:16:53,119 --> 04:16:54,786
Yes, Marty. I know.

3642
04:16:55,746 --> 04:16:56,830
I went
to the public library

3643
04:16:56,914 --> 04:16:58,832
to try to make sense
out of all the madness.

3644
04:16:58,916 --> 04:17:00,375
The place was
boarded up, shut down,

3645
04:17:00,459 --> 04:17:02,377
so I broke in and
borrowed some newspapers.

3646
04:17:02,461 --> 04:17:03,920
I don't get it, Doc.

3647
04:17:04,130 --> 04:17:06,089
I mean, how can all
this be happening?

3648
04:17:06,173 --> 04:17:07,632
It's like we're in
hell or something.

3649
04:17:07,717 --> 04:17:10,719
No, it's Hill Valley. Although, I
can't imagine hell being much worse.

3650
04:17:12,805 --> 04:17:15,515
Oh, Einie.
I'm sorry, boy.

3651
04:17:16,267 --> 04:17:19,602
The lab is an awful,
awful, awful, awful mess.

3652
04:17:20,896 --> 04:17:22,272
Attaboy.

3653
04:17:22,982 --> 04:17:26,192
Obviously, the time
continuum has been disrupted,

3654
04:17:26,277 --> 04:17:28,695
creating this new
temporal event sequence

3655
04:17:28,779 --> 04:17:30,530
resulting in this
alternate reality.

3656
04:17:30,614 --> 04:17:31,656
English, Doc.

3657
04:17:31,741 --> 04:17:34,034
Here, here, here.
Let me illustrate.

3658
04:17:38,748 --> 04:17:42,876
Imagine that this line
represents time.

3659
04:17:42,960 --> 04:17:47,756
Here's the present, 1985,
the future and the past.

3660
04:17:49,508 --> 04:17:52,635
Prior to this point in
time, somewhere in the past,

3661
04:17:52,720 --> 04:17:55,180
the timeline skewed
into this tangent

3662
04:17:55,264 --> 04:17:58,266
creating
an alternate 1985.

3663
04:17:58,350 --> 04:18:02,145
Alternate to you,
me and Einstein,

3664
04:18:02,646 --> 04:18:05,690
but reality for
everyone else.

3665
04:18:09,987 --> 04:18:11,821
Recognize this?

3666
04:18:12,073 --> 04:18:14,115
It's the bag
the sports book came in.

3667
04:18:14,200 --> 04:18:17,077
I know, because the
receipt was still inside.

3668
04:18:17,161 --> 04:18:21,081
I found them in the time
machine along with this.

3669
04:18:26,670 --> 04:18:28,755
It's the top
of Biff's cane.

3670
04:18:28,839 --> 04:18:30,423
I mean,
Old Biff from the future.

3671
04:18:30,508 --> 04:18:32,467
Correct. It was
in the time machine

3672
04:18:32,551 --> 04:18:36,846
because Biff was in the time
machine with the sports almanac.

3673
04:18:37,515 --> 04:18:38,598
Holy shit.

3674
04:18:38,682 --> 04:18:41,518
You see, while we were in the future,

3675
04:18:41,602 --> 04:18:43,061
Biff got
the sports book,

3676
04:18:43,145 --> 04:18:45,480
stole the time machine,
went back in time,

3677
04:18:45,564 --> 04:18:48,942
and gave the book to himself
at some point in the past.

3678
04:18:49,235 --> 04:18:53,404
Look. It says right here

3679
04:18:53,489 --> 04:18:55,657
that Biff made
his first million

3680
04:18:55,741 --> 04:18:58,701
betting on a horse race
in 1958.

3681
04:18:59,328 --> 04:19:00,620
He wasn't just lucky.

3682
04:19:00,704 --> 04:19:04,207
He knew because he had all the
race results in the sports almanac.

3683
04:19:04,458 --> 04:19:07,168
That's how he made
his entire fortune.

3684
04:19:07,878 --> 04:19:10,213
Look at his pocket
with a magnifying glass.

3685
04:19:12,675 --> 04:19:14,217
The almanac.

3686
04:19:15,052 --> 04:19:17,428
Son of a bitch
stole my idea.

3687
04:19:18,264 --> 04:19:20,557
He must have been
listening when I...

3688
04:19:22,518 --> 04:19:25,728
It's my fault. The
whole thing is my fault.

3689
04:19:25,813 --> 04:19:27,814
If I hadn't bought
that damn book,

3690
04:19:27,898 --> 04:19:29,440
none of this would
have ever happened.

3691
04:19:29,525 --> 04:19:30,650
Well, it's all
in the past.

3692
04:19:30,734 --> 04:19:31,818
You mean the future?

3693
04:19:31,902 --> 04:19:34,779
Whatever.
It demonstrates precisely

3694
04:19:34,864 --> 04:19:36,656
how time travel
can be misused

3695
04:19:36,740 --> 04:19:39,868
and why the time machine
must be destroyed

3696
04:19:39,952 --> 04:19:42,328
after we straighten
all of this out.

3697
04:19:42,413 --> 04:19:44,497
Right. So we go
back to the future,

3698
04:19:44,582 --> 04:19:46,708
and we stop Biff from
stealing the time machine.

3699
04:19:46,792 --> 04:19:49,335
We can't,
because if we travel

3700
04:19:49,420 --> 04:19:51,880
into the future from
this point in time,

3701
04:19:51,964 --> 04:19:55,508
it will be the future
of this reality,

3702
04:19:56,302 --> 04:19:59,470
in which Biff is
corrupt and powerful

3703
04:19:59,555 --> 04:20:01,472
and married
to your mother

3704
04:20:01,557 --> 04:20:06,436
and in which this
has happened to me.

3705
04:20:11,942 --> 04:20:16,821
No. Our only chance to repair
the present is in the past

3706
04:20:16,906 --> 04:20:21,034
at the point where the timeline
skewed into this tangent.

3707
04:20:21,118 --> 04:20:25,205
In order to put the universe
back as we remember it

3708
04:20:25,289 --> 04:20:27,624
and get back
to our reality,

3709
04:20:27,708 --> 04:20:29,542
we have to find
out the exact date

3710
04:20:29,627 --> 04:20:31,419
and the specific
circumstances

3711
04:20:31,503 --> 04:20:34,339
of how, where
and when Young Biff

3712
04:20:34,423 --> 04:20:36,841
got his hands on
that sports almanac.

3713
04:20:39,637 --> 04:20:40,803
I'll ask him.

3714
04:21:04,453 --> 04:21:08,623
Bulletproof vest! Great
flick! Great frigging flick!

3715
04:21:08,916 --> 04:21:11,000
The guy is brilliant.

3716
04:21:11,502 --> 04:21:13,127
Hey, what the hell's
going...

3717
04:21:13,254 --> 04:21:15,755
Hey! What the hell
are you doing in here?

3718
04:21:15,839 --> 04:21:17,006
Party's over, Biff.

3719
04:21:18,884 --> 04:21:20,176
Sorry, ladies.

3720
04:21:20,261 --> 04:21:23,012
How did you get past
my security downstairs?

3721
04:21:23,681 --> 04:21:25,390
There's a little matter
we need to talk about.

3722
04:21:25,474 --> 04:21:27,809
Yeah. Money, right?
Well, forget it.

3723
04:21:27,893 --> 04:21:29,769
No. Not money.

3724
04:21:31,689 --> 04:21:35,149
Gray's Sports Almanac.

3725
04:21:38,570 --> 04:21:40,530
You heard him, girls.

3726
04:21:41,031 --> 04:21:42,490
Party's over.

3727
04:21:43,701 --> 04:21:47,203
Start talking, kid. What
else you know about that book?

3728
04:21:48,914 --> 04:21:51,708
First, you tell me
how you got it.

3729
04:21:52,209 --> 04:21:55,461
How, where and when.

3730
04:21:57,881 --> 04:22:00,216
All right.
Take a seat.

3731
04:22:04,221 --> 04:22:05,555
Sit down!

3732
04:22:09,727 --> 04:22:12,520
November 12, 1955.
That was when.

3733
04:22:12,604 --> 04:22:15,773
November 12, 1955. That
was the date I went back...

3734
04:22:17,067 --> 04:22:21,112
That was the date of the famous
Hill Valley lightning storm.

3735
04:22:22,281 --> 04:22:24,949
You know your history.
Very good.

3736
04:22:25,909 --> 04:22:27,660
I'll never forget
that Saturday.

3737
04:22:27,745 --> 04:22:29,454
I'd just picked
my car up from the shop,

3738
04:22:29,538 --> 04:22:32,707
'cause I'd rolled it in a
drag race a few days earlier.

3739
04:22:32,791 --> 04:22:35,418
I thought you crashed
into a manure truck.

3740
04:22:36,795 --> 04:22:39,380
How do you know
about that?

3741
04:22:39,465 --> 04:22:41,257
My father told me
about it.

3742
04:22:41,342 --> 04:22:42,592
Your father?

3743
04:22:43,844 --> 04:22:45,762
Before he died.

3744
04:22:46,805 --> 04:22:48,306
Yeah. Right.

3745
04:22:49,516 --> 04:22:52,393
So there I was,
minding my own business.

3746
04:22:52,478 --> 04:22:55,772
This crazy old codger
with a cane shows up.

3747
04:22:55,856 --> 04:22:57,857
He says he's my
distant relative.

3748
04:22:57,941 --> 04:22:59,609
I don't see
any resemblance.

3749
04:23:01,612 --> 04:23:04,447
So he says, "How would
you like to be rich?"

3750
04:23:05,032 --> 04:23:06,908
So I said, "Sure. "

3751
04:23:11,663 --> 04:23:13,706
So he lays
this book on me.

3752
04:23:13,791 --> 04:23:15,541
He says this book
will tell me the outcome

3753
04:23:15,626 --> 04:23:18,294
of every sporting event
till the end of the century.

3754
04:23:18,379 --> 04:23:21,839
All I have to do is bet on the
winner, and I'll never lose.

3755
04:23:25,052 --> 04:23:26,594
So I said,
"What's the catch?"

3756
04:23:26,678 --> 04:23:29,764
He says, "No catch.
Just keep it a secret. "

3757
04:23:33,852 --> 04:23:36,396
After that,
he disappeared.

3758
04:23:36,480 --> 04:23:37,814
I never saw him again.

3759
04:23:50,536 --> 04:23:52,745
Oh, and he told me
one more thing.

3760
04:23:52,830 --> 04:23:55,581
He said, "Someday a
crazy, wild-eyed scientist,

3761
04:23:55,666 --> 04:23:59,127
"or a kid may show up
asking about that book.

3762
04:23:59,211 --> 04:24:01,421
"And if that
ever happens... "

3763
04:24:06,510 --> 04:24:09,846
Funny. I never
thought it would be you.

3764
04:24:10,764 --> 04:24:12,473
Yeah, well, Biff, you're
forgetting one thing.

3765
04:24:12,558 --> 04:24:14,350
What the hell is that?

3766
04:24:20,190 --> 04:24:23,234
You're dead,
you little son of a bitch!

3767
04:24:35,456 --> 04:24:36,456
Hey, there he is!

3768
04:24:36,540 --> 04:24:37,748
Hey, hey!

3769
04:24:52,681 --> 04:24:53,973
Oh, yeah!

3770
04:25:19,958 --> 04:25:22,627
Go ahead, kid. Jump.

3771
04:25:23,378 --> 04:25:26,172
A suicide will
be nice and neat.

3772
04:25:26,256 --> 04:25:27,924
What if I don't?

3773
04:25:28,842 --> 04:25:30,593
Lead poisoning.

3774
04:25:30,677 --> 04:25:32,553
What about
the police, Biff?

3775
04:25:32,638 --> 04:25:35,097
They're gonna match up
the bullet with that gun.

3776
04:25:35,182 --> 04:25:37,266
Kid, I own the police.

3777
04:25:39,269 --> 04:25:41,437
Besides,
they couldn't match up

3778
04:25:41,522 --> 04:25:43,606
the bullet that
killed your old man.

3779
04:25:44,066 --> 04:25:45,441
You son of a...

3780
04:25:47,903 --> 04:25:50,321
I suppose it's
poetic justice.

3781
04:25:51,156 --> 04:25:55,284
Two McFlys
with the same gun.

3782
04:26:06,630 --> 04:26:07,630
Idiot.

3783
04:26:12,636 --> 04:26:13,886
What the hell?

3784
04:26:18,850 --> 04:26:20,351
Nice shot, Doc!

3785
04:26:21,895 --> 04:26:23,563
You're not
gonna believe this.

3786
04:26:23,647 --> 04:26:25,481
We gotta
go back to 1955.

3787
04:26:25,566 --> 04:26:27,233
I don't believe it.

3788
04:26:38,829 --> 04:26:41,080
That's right, Doc.
November 12, 1955.

3789
04:26:41,164 --> 04:26:44,750
Unbelievable that Old Biff could've
chosen that particular date.

3790
04:26:44,835 --> 04:26:45,876
It could mean that
that point in time

3791
04:26:45,961 --> 04:26:48,588
inherently contains some
sort of cosmic significance,

3792
04:26:48,672 --> 04:26:50,590
almost as if it were
the temporal junction point

3793
04:26:50,674 --> 04:26:52,842
for the entire
space-time continuum.

3794
04:26:52,926 --> 04:26:55,803
On the other hand, it could
just be an amazing coincidence.

3795
04:26:58,599 --> 04:27:01,267
Damn!
Got to fix that thing.

3796
04:27:01,351 --> 04:27:02,727
All right.
Time circuits on.

3797
04:27:03,770 --> 04:27:05,855
What do you mean,
time circuits on?

3798
04:27:05,939 --> 04:27:07,565
Doc, we're not
going back now.

3799
04:27:07,649 --> 04:27:08,691
Yep.

3800
04:27:08,775 --> 04:27:10,526
Doc, what about Jennifer?
What about Einstein?

3801
04:27:10,611 --> 04:27:11,986
We can't just
leave them here.

3802
04:27:12,070 --> 04:27:14,196
Don't worry, Marty. Assuming
we succeed in our mission,

3803
04:27:14,281 --> 04:27:17,783
this alternate 1985 will be
changed back into the real 1985,

3804
04:27:17,868 --> 04:27:21,120
instantaneously transforming
around Jennifer and Einie.

3805
04:27:21,204 --> 04:27:22,747
Jennifer and Einie
will be fine,

3806
04:27:22,831 --> 04:27:25,583
and they will have absolutely
no memory of this horrible place.

3807
04:27:25,709 --> 04:27:27,126
Doc.

3808
04:27:27,711 --> 04:27:29,545
What if we don't succeed?

3809
04:27:30,297 --> 04:27:31,714
We must succeed.

3810
04:29:21,900 --> 04:29:23,234
Well, Doc,

3811
04:29:24,945 --> 04:29:26,696
it's destroyed.

3812
04:29:28,907 --> 04:29:30,908
Just like you wanted.

3813
04:29:49,845 --> 04:29:50,928
Hey, butthead,
get away...

3814
04:29:51,013 --> 04:29:52,013
Watch it, Biff!

3815
04:29:52,097 --> 04:29:54,015
Marty, I didn't mean
to scare you.

3816
04:29:54,099 --> 04:29:55,350
I didn't recognize you
in those clothes.

3817
04:29:55,434 --> 04:29:56,851
What the hell
are you doing?

3818
04:29:56,935 --> 04:29:59,687
Just putting on
the second coat now.

3819
04:30:00,814 --> 04:30:02,190
You going cowboy, huh?

3820
04:30:02,274 --> 04:30:04,984
Come on, guys. We're
gonna be late for brunch.

3821
04:30:05,069 --> 04:30:06,069
Coming, Dave.

3822
04:30:06,153 --> 04:30:07,445
Come on, Dad,
we're not gonna hold

3823
04:30:07,529 --> 04:30:09,030
your reservations
all day.

3824
04:30:09,114 --> 04:30:10,531
I can't
find my glasses.

3825
04:30:10,616 --> 04:30:11,908
Lorraine, have you seen my glasses?

3826
04:30:11,992 --> 04:30:14,035
They're in your
suede jacket, honey.

3827
04:30:14,119 --> 04:30:16,788
Marty, what's wrong? We
thought you went to the lake.

3828
04:30:16,872 --> 04:30:18,039
You wore that
to the lake?

3829
04:30:18,123 --> 04:30:20,041
Thank God you guys
are all back to normal.

3830
04:30:20,125 --> 04:30:22,126
Marty, who are you supposed
to be? Clint Eastwood?

3831
04:30:23,462 --> 04:30:26,005
Right.
I gotta go get Jennifer.

3832
04:30:30,260 --> 04:30:31,803
I really like
that hat, Marty.

3833
04:30:31,887 --> 04:30:33,429
Thanks, Biff.

3834
04:30:47,820 --> 04:30:49,153
Jennifer.

3835
04:30:51,198 --> 04:30:52,448
Jen.

3836
04:30:56,703 --> 04:30:57,995
Jennifer.

3837
04:31:21,103 --> 04:31:25,148
Marty.

3838
04:31:26,692 --> 04:31:28,568
I had the worst
nightmare.

3839
04:31:35,033 --> 04:31:38,494
Marty, that dream
I had is so real.

3840
04:31:38,579 --> 04:31:41,038
It was about
the future.

3841
04:31:41,123 --> 04:31:43,124
About us.

3842
04:31:43,208 --> 04:31:45,460
And you got fired.

3843
04:31:45,544 --> 04:31:47,879
Wait a minute. What do
you mean I got fired?

3844
04:31:48,797 --> 04:31:50,006
"Hilldale. "

3845
04:31:51,300 --> 04:31:54,635
Hilldale!
This is where we live.

3846
04:31:54,720 --> 04:31:57,722
I mean, this is where
we're going to live.

3847
04:31:59,224 --> 04:32:00,266
Someday.

3848
04:32:03,520 --> 04:32:06,731
Marty, it was a dream,
wasn't it?

3849
04:32:10,611 --> 04:32:11,944
Hey.

3850
04:32:12,029 --> 04:32:14,155
The big M.

3851
04:32:14,239 --> 04:32:16,240
How's it hanging, McFly?

3852
04:32:16,325 --> 04:32:17,575
Hey, Needles.

3853
04:32:17,659 --> 04:32:21,787
Nice set of wheels.
Let's see what she can do.

3854
04:32:21,872 --> 04:32:22,955
Next green light.

3855
04:32:23,040 --> 04:32:24,081
No, thanks.

3856
04:32:25,417 --> 04:32:27,960
What's the matter?
Chicken?

3857
04:32:28,462 --> 04:32:30,004
Chicken McFly.

3858
04:32:30,255 --> 04:32:31,214
Whoo!

3859
04:32:32,633 --> 04:32:34,091
Marty, don't.

3860
04:32:34,176 --> 04:32:35,593
Grab hold of something.

3861
04:32:36,595 --> 04:32:38,304
Come on!
Get on!

3862
04:32:39,723 --> 04:32:41,933
Yeah, go! Go, go, go!

3863
04:33:04,581 --> 04:33:05,915
Did you
do that on purpose?

3864
04:33:05,999 --> 04:33:08,459
Yeah, you think I'm stupid
enough to race that asshole?

3865
04:33:14,675 --> 04:33:17,677
Jeez! I would have
hit that Rolls-Royce.

3866
04:33:27,521 --> 04:33:29,313
It erased.

3867
04:33:43,370 --> 04:33:45,246
You're right. There's not much left.

3868
04:33:47,833 --> 04:33:49,875
Doc's never
coming back.

3869
04:34:04,349 --> 04:34:05,975
I'm sure gonna
miss him, Jen.

3870
04:34:18,655 --> 04:34:19,739
What the hell?

3871
04:34:37,174 --> 04:34:38,299
Doc!

3872
04:34:38,800 --> 04:34:39,884
Marty!

3873
04:34:39,968 --> 04:34:42,136
Doc! Doc!

3874
04:34:42,220 --> 04:34:45,097
Marty,
it runs on steam!

3875
04:34:50,395 --> 04:34:53,898
Meet the family.
Clara, you know.

3876
04:34:53,982 --> 04:34:55,149
Hi, Marty!

3877
04:34:55,233 --> 04:34:56,317
Ma'am!

3878
04:34:57,361 --> 04:34:59,528
These are our boys.

3879
04:35:00,322 --> 04:35:04,116
Jules and Verne.

3880
04:35:07,245 --> 04:35:10,081
Boys, this is Marty and Jennifer.

3881
04:35:13,085 --> 04:35:15,044
Doc, I thought I'd
never see you again.

3882
04:35:15,128 --> 04:35:17,338
You can't keep
a good scientist down.

3883
04:35:17,422 --> 04:35:19,548
After all, I had to
come back for Einstein,

3884
04:35:19,633 --> 04:35:22,927
and, well, I didn't want
you to be worried about me.

3885
04:35:23,553 --> 04:35:24,553
Oh!

3886
04:35:25,013 --> 04:35:27,473
I brought you
a little souvenir.

3887
04:35:44,157 --> 04:35:47,326
It's great, Doc.
Thanks.

3888
04:35:49,705 --> 04:35:53,541
Dr. Brown, I brought this
note back from the future,

3889
04:35:53,625 --> 04:35:55,876
and now it's erased.

3890
04:35:55,961 --> 04:35:57,920
Of course
it's erased.

3891
04:35:59,840 --> 04:36:01,173
But what does
that mean?

3892
04:36:01,258 --> 04:36:05,136
It means your future
hasn't been written yet.

3893
04:36:05,220 --> 04:36:06,971
No one's has.

3894
04:36:07,055 --> 04:36:09,473
Your future is
whatever you make it.

3895
04:36:09,558 --> 04:36:12,101
So make it a good one,
both of you.

3896
04:36:15,230 --> 04:36:16,439
We will, Doc!

3897
04:36:16,523 --> 04:36:18,065
Stand back!

3898
04:36:18,567 --> 04:36:20,651
All right, boys,
buckle up!

3899
04:36:25,657 --> 04:36:30,828
Hey, Doc, where are you
going now? Back to the future?

3900
04:36:31,413 --> 04:36:34,665
No, already been there.

3901
04:37:21,300 --> 04:37:22,383
What the hell
was that?

3902
04:37:22,468 --> 04:37:23,509
Taxicab.

3903
04:37:24,303 --> 04:37:26,262
What do you mean a "taxicab"?
I thought we were flying.

3904
04:37:26,346 --> 04:37:27,346
Precisely.

3905
04:37:27,723 --> 04:37:29,766
All right, Doc.
What's going on, huh?

3906
04:37:29,850 --> 04:37:31,559
Where are we?
When are we?

3907
04:37:31,769 --> 04:37:35,229
We're descending toward
Hill Valley, California,

3908
04:37:35,314 --> 04:37:40,443
at 4:29 p. m. On Wednesday,
October 21, 2015.

3909
04:37:40,527 --> 04:37:42,195
2015?

3910
04:37:43,614 --> 04:37:45,531
You mean
we're in the future.

3911
04:37:45,616 --> 04:37:46,741
Future.
Marty, what do you mean?

3912
04:37:46,825 --> 04:37:49,285
How can we be
in the future?

3913
04:37:49,870 --> 04:37:51,204
Jennifer...

3914
04:37:52,706 --> 04:37:54,999
I don't know how
to tell you this,

3915
04:37:55,751 --> 04:37:57,919
but you're
in a time machine.

3916
04:37:58,003 --> 04:38:00,671
And this is
the year 2015?

3917
04:38:00,756 --> 04:38:02,673
October 21, 2015.

3918
04:38:03,050 --> 04:38:05,551
God, so, like,
you weren't kidding.

3919
04:38:05,636 --> 04:38:08,221
Marty, we can
actually see our future.

3920
04:38:08,305 --> 04:38:10,431
Doc, now, you said
we were married, right?

3921
04:38:10,516 --> 04:38:11,516
Yeah...

3922
04:38:11,600 --> 04:38:13,851
Yeah?
Was it a big wedding?

3923
04:38:13,936 --> 04:38:15,853
Marty, we're gonna be able
to see our wedding.

3924
04:38:15,979 --> 04:38:17,897
Wow. I'm gonna be able
to see my wedding dress.

3925
04:38:17,981 --> 04:38:18,981
Wow.

3926
04:38:19,066 --> 04:38:20,066
God, I wonder
where we live.

3927
04:38:20,150 --> 04:38:22,777
I bet it's a big house
with lots of kids.

3928
04:38:22,861 --> 04:38:23,986
How many kids...

3929
04:38:24,071 --> 04:38:25,613
Doc! What the hell
are you doing?

3930
04:38:25,697 --> 04:38:26,864
Relax, Marty.

3931
04:38:26,949 --> 04:38:29,575
It's just a sleep-inducing
alpha rhythm generator.

3932
04:38:29,660 --> 04:38:30,660
She was asking
too many questions,

3933
04:38:30,744 --> 04:38:32,620
and no one should know too
much about their future.

3934
04:38:32,830 --> 04:38:33,996
This way
when she wakes up,

3935
04:38:34,081 --> 04:38:35,915
she'll think it
was all a dream.

3936
04:38:35,999 --> 04:38:37,667
Then what did
you bring her for?

3937
04:38:37,751 --> 04:38:38,835
I had to do something.

3938
04:38:38,919 --> 04:38:42,421
She saw the time machine. I couldn't just
leave her there with that information.

3939
04:38:42,506 --> 04:38:44,715
Don't worry. She's not
essential to my plan.

3940
04:38:45,801 --> 04:38:47,385
Well, you're the doc,
Doc.

3941
04:38:47,469 --> 04:38:48,594
Here's our exit.

3942
04:39:17,958 --> 04:39:20,084
First, you've gotta get
out and change clothes.

3943
04:39:20,168 --> 04:39:22,378
Right now?
It's pouring rain.

3944
04:39:25,215 --> 04:39:27,341
Wait five more seconds.

3945
04:39:35,017 --> 04:39:36,809
Right on the tick.

3946
04:39:36,894 --> 04:39:40,271
Amazing.
Absolutely amazing.

3947
04:39:40,355 --> 04:39:44,108
Too bad the post office isn't as
efficient as the weather service.

3948
04:39:51,658 --> 04:39:52,867
Excuse the disguise,
Marty,

3949
04:39:52,951 --> 04:39:54,911
but I was afraid you
wouldn't recognize me.

3950
04:39:54,995 --> 04:39:56,245
I went to
a rejuvenation clinic

3951
04:39:56,330 --> 04:39:57,830
and got
an all-natural overhaul.

3952
04:39:58,165 --> 04:40:01,792
They took out some wrinkles, did
a hair repair, changed the blood,

3953
04:40:01,877 --> 04:40:04,795
added a good 30 or
40 years to my life.

3954
04:40:04,880 --> 04:40:08,257
They also replaced my spleen
and colon. What do you think?

3955
04:40:09,927 --> 04:40:12,178
You look great, Doc.

3956
04:40:14,681 --> 04:40:16,182
The future.

3957
04:40:17,225 --> 04:40:19,310
Unbelievable.

3958
04:40:19,394 --> 04:40:20,895
I gotta
check this out, Doc.

3959
04:40:20,979 --> 04:40:22,063
All in good time, Marty.

3960
04:40:22,147 --> 04:40:23,272
We're on a tight
schedule here.

3961
04:40:23,357 --> 04:40:25,775
Tell me about my future.
I mean, I know I make it big.

3962
04:40:25,859 --> 04:40:27,693
But what? Do I become,
like, a rich rock star?

3963
04:40:27,778 --> 04:40:29,946
Please, Marty, no one should know
too much about their own destiny.

3964
04:40:30,030 --> 04:40:31,447
Right. Right.

3965
04:40:31,531 --> 04:40:32,573
I am rich, though, right?

3966
04:40:32,658 --> 04:40:35,409
Marty, please,
take off your shirt.

3967
04:40:36,495 --> 04:40:39,080
Put on the jacket
and the shoes.

3968
04:40:40,874 --> 04:40:42,750
Got a mission
to accomplish.

3969
04:40:57,557 --> 04:40:58,641
Ah-ha.

3970
04:40:58,725 --> 04:41:00,101
Precisely on schedule.

3971
04:41:05,649 --> 04:41:07,233
Power laces.
All right.

3972
04:41:27,796 --> 04:41:29,380
This thing doesn't fit.

3973
04:41:29,464 --> 04:41:31,424
Size-adjusting fit.

3974
04:41:31,508 --> 04:41:32,883
Pull out
your pants pockets.

3975
04:41:32,968 --> 04:41:35,761
All kids in the future
wear their pants inside out.

3976
04:41:35,846 --> 04:41:37,263
Put on this cap.

3977
04:41:37,347 --> 04:41:40,016
Perfect. You're the spitting
image of your future son.

3978
04:41:40,100 --> 04:41:41,142
What?

3979
04:41:41,226 --> 04:41:43,227
Help me move
Jennifer over here.

3980
04:41:43,937 --> 04:41:44,937
So what's the deal?

3981
04:41:45,022 --> 04:41:46,397
Grab her feet.

3982
04:41:46,481 --> 04:41:49,108
All right.
Okay, now what?

3983
04:41:49,818 --> 04:41:53,946
In exactly two minutes, you go
around the corner into the Cafe '80s.

3984
04:41:54,448 --> 04:41:55,698
Cafe '80s?

3985
04:41:55,782 --> 04:41:58,409
It's one of those nostalgia
places, but not done very well.

3986
04:41:58,493 --> 04:42:01,120
Go in and order a Pepsi.
Here's a 50.

3987
04:42:01,204 --> 04:42:03,080
Then wait for
a guy named Griff.

3988
04:42:03,206 --> 04:42:04,957
Right. Griff.
Right.

3989
04:42:05,042 --> 04:42:08,002
Griff's going to ask you about
tonight. Are you in or out?

3990
04:42:08,086 --> 04:42:09,545
Tell him you are out.

3991
04:42:09,629 --> 04:42:10,713
Whatever he says,
whatever happens,

3992
04:42:10,797 --> 04:42:12,048
say no,
you're not interested.

3993
04:42:12,132 --> 04:42:13,174
Okay.

3994
04:42:13,258 --> 04:42:15,634
Then leave, come back
here and wait for me.

3995
04:42:16,803 --> 04:42:20,389
Don't talk to anyone, don't
touch anything, don't do anything,

3996
04:42:20,474 --> 04:42:21,849
don't interact
with anyone

3997
04:42:21,933 --> 04:42:24,143
and try not to
look at anything.

3998
04:42:24,227 --> 04:42:25,603
I don't get it.
I thought you said

3999
04:42:25,687 --> 04:42:26,937
this had something
to do with my kids.

4000
04:42:27,022 --> 04:42:29,148
Look what happens
to your son.

4001
04:42:30,650 --> 04:42:31,942
My son?

4002
04:42:33,487 --> 04:42:35,738
God, he looks
just like me.

4003
04:42:35,822 --> 04:42:39,575
"Within two hours of his
arrest, Martin McFly Jr

4004
04:42:39,659 --> 04:42:40,910
"was tried,
convicted and sentenced

4005
04:42:40,994 --> 04:42:43,662
"to 15 years in
a state penitentiary. "

4006
04:42:43,747 --> 04:42:45,122
Within two hours?

4007
04:42:45,207 --> 04:42:46,707
The justice system works
swiftly in the future

4008
04:42:46,792 --> 04:42:48,959
now that they've
abolished all lawyers.

4009
04:42:49,044 --> 04:42:50,461
Oh, this is heavy.

4010
04:42:50,545 --> 04:42:51,921
It gets worse.
Next week, your daughter

4011
04:42:52,005 --> 04:42:53,089
attempts to break him
out of jail,

4012
04:42:53,173 --> 04:42:55,424
and she gets sent up
for 20 years.

4013
04:42:55,509 --> 04:42:57,593
My daughter. Wait a
minute. I have a daughter?

4014
04:42:57,677 --> 04:43:00,387
You see? This one event
starts a chain reaction

4015
04:43:00,472 --> 04:43:02,264
that completely destroys
your entire family.

4016
04:43:03,683 --> 04:43:06,769
Hey, Doc, this date...
This is tomorrow's newspaper.

4017
04:43:06,853 --> 04:43:08,938
Precisely, I already went
further ahead into time

4018
04:43:09,022 --> 04:43:10,231
to see
what else happens.

4019
04:43:10,315 --> 04:43:11,816
I backtracked everything
to this one event.

4020
04:43:11,900 --> 04:43:12,942
That's why
we're here today,

4021
04:43:13,026 --> 04:43:14,485
to prevent this incident
from ever happening.

4022
04:43:15,904 --> 04:43:17,738
Damn! I'm late!

4023
04:43:17,823 --> 04:43:19,115
Wait a minute.
Where you going now?

4024
04:43:19,199 --> 04:43:20,616
To intercept
the real Marty Jr.

4025
04:43:20,700 --> 04:43:23,119
You're taking his place. Around
the corner at the Cafe '80s.

4026
04:43:23,203 --> 04:43:25,287
Guy named Griff.
Just say no!

4027
04:43:25,914 --> 04:43:28,499
Hey, what about Jennifer? We're
not just gonna leave her here.

4028
04:43:28,583 --> 04:43:29,667
Don't worry,
she'll be safe.

4029
04:43:29,751 --> 04:43:31,544
It'll just be
for a few minutes.

4030
04:43:31,628 --> 04:43:33,838
And, Marty, be careful
around that Griff character.

4031
04:43:33,922 --> 04:43:37,383
He's got a few short circuits
in his bionic implants.

4032
04:43:40,804 --> 04:43:42,346
The future.

4033
04:44:33,356 --> 04:44:35,441
Welcome to Texaco.

4034
04:44:36,193 --> 04:44:39,695
You can trust your car
to the system with the star.

4035
04:44:40,322 --> 04:44:43,407
Checking oil.
Checking landing gear.

4036
04:44:59,049 --> 04:45:00,382
The shark
still looks fake.

4037
04:45:00,467 --> 04:45:02,760
Hi, friends.
Goldie Wilson III

4038
04:45:02,844 --> 04:45:04,637
for Wilson Hover
Conversion Systems.

4039
04:45:05,013 --> 04:45:08,265
You know, when my grandpa
was mayor of Hill Valley,

4040
04:45:08,350 --> 04:45:10,726
he had to worry
about traffic problems.

4041
04:45:10,810 --> 04:45:13,562
But now, you don't have
to worry about traffic.

4042
04:45:13,647 --> 04:45:16,482
I'll hover-convert
your old road car

4043
04:45:16,566 --> 04:45:22,988
into a skyway flier
for only $39,999.95.

4044
04:45:23,114 --> 04:45:26,408
So come on down and see me,
Goldie Wilson III,

4045
04:45:26,493 --> 04:45:29,662
at any one of our 29
convenient locations.

4046
04:45:29,746 --> 04:45:31,830
Remember,
keep 'em flying.

4047
04:45:54,354 --> 04:45:57,481
It's got a hot salsa,
avocados,

4048
04:45:57,565 --> 04:46:00,317
cilantro mixed with
your choice of beans,

4049
04:46:00,402 --> 04:46:02,528
chicken, beef or pork.

4050
04:46:03,071 --> 04:46:05,072
Waiter. Waiter.

4051
04:46:08,535 --> 04:46:10,160
Welcome to the Cafe '80s,

4052
04:46:10,245 --> 04:46:13,956
where it's always morning in
America, even in the afternoon.

4053
04:46:15,625 --> 04:46:18,168
Our special today is
mesquite-grilled sushi.

4054
04:46:18,253 --> 04:46:20,587
You must have the hostage
special! Cajun style.

4055
04:46:20,672 --> 04:46:25,634
You must have
the hostage special!

4056
04:46:25,719 --> 04:46:28,887
Hey, hey, hey, guys!
Hey, hey, guys!

4057
04:46:28,972 --> 04:46:30,556
All I want is a Pepsi.

4058
04:46:36,021 --> 04:46:37,646
Hey, McFly!

4059
04:46:38,815 --> 04:46:41,066
Yeah.
I've seen you around.

4060
04:46:41,818 --> 04:46:44,069
You're Marty McFly's kid,
aren't you?

4061
04:46:45,155 --> 04:46:46,363
Biff?

4062
04:46:46,448 --> 04:46:47,865
You're Marty Jr.

4063
04:46:48,700 --> 04:46:49,825
Tough break, kid.

4064
04:46:49,909 --> 04:46:52,870
Must be rough being named
after a complete butthead.

4065
04:46:52,954 --> 04:46:54,330
What's that
supposed to mean?

4066
04:46:54,414 --> 04:46:55,998
Hello? Hello?
Anybody home?

4067
04:46:56,082 --> 04:46:57,374
Hey. Hey.

4068
04:46:57,459 --> 04:46:59,168
Think, McFly, think!

4069
04:46:59,252 --> 04:47:02,087
Your old man?
Mr. Loser?

4070
04:47:02,589 --> 04:47:03,547
What?

4071
04:47:03,631 --> 04:47:04,631
That's right.

4072
04:47:05,175 --> 04:47:07,551
Loser with a capital "L."

4073
04:47:08,261 --> 04:47:10,637
Look, I happen to know George
McFly is no longer a loser.

4074
04:47:10,722 --> 04:47:12,514
No, I'm not talking
about George McFly.

4075
04:47:12,599 --> 04:47:14,099
I'm talking
about his kid.

4076
04:47:14,267 --> 04:47:17,853
Your old man,
Marty McFly Sr.,

4077
04:47:18,355 --> 04:47:20,022
the man who
took his life

4078
04:47:20,106 --> 04:47:22,775
and flushed it
completely down the toilet.

4079
04:47:24,110 --> 04:47:25,361
I did?

4080
04:47:26,446 --> 04:47:28,614
I mean...
I mean, he did?

4081
04:47:29,491 --> 04:47:30,699
Hey, Gramps,

4082
04:47:30,784 --> 04:47:33,869
I told you two coats of
wax on my car, not just one!

4083
04:47:34,412 --> 04:47:37,414
Hey, hey, I just put the
second coat on last week.

4084
04:47:37,499 --> 04:47:39,208
Yeah?
With your eyes closed?

4085
04:47:39,292 --> 04:47:40,376
Are you two related?

4086
04:47:40,460 --> 04:47:43,962
Hello? Hello?
Anybody home?

4087
04:47:44,047 --> 04:47:46,799
What do you think, Griff just
calls me "Grandpa" for his health?

4088
04:47:46,883 --> 04:47:48,801
He's Griff?
Gramps!

4089
04:47:49,552 --> 04:47:51,720
What the hell
am I paying you for?

4090
04:47:51,805 --> 04:47:54,807
Hey, kid, say hello
to your grandma for me.

4091
04:47:54,891 --> 04:47:56,266
Get out here, Gramps.

4092
04:47:56,351 --> 04:47:58,352
Hey, take it easy!

4093
04:47:59,771 --> 04:48:02,856
And, McFly, don't go
anywhere! You're next!

4094
04:48:05,235 --> 04:48:07,486
This is a video game.

4095
04:48:09,197 --> 04:48:10,906
I got it working.

4096
04:48:10,990 --> 04:48:13,325
My dad taught me
about these.

4097
04:48:13,618 --> 04:48:15,494
It is Wild Gunman.

4098
04:48:15,578 --> 04:48:17,121
How do you play
this thing?

4099
04:48:17,205 --> 04:48:18,997
I'll show you, kid.

4100
04:48:19,958 --> 04:48:21,875
I'm a crack shot at this.

4101
04:48:27,757 --> 04:48:29,258
You mean you have
to use your hands?

4102
04:48:29,342 --> 04:48:31,510
That's like
a baby's toy.

4103
04:48:33,763 --> 04:48:35,347
Baby's toy?

4104
04:48:43,606 --> 04:48:44,940
Pepsi Perfect.

4105
04:48:45,024 --> 04:48:46,859
Damn!
Pepsi.

4106
04:48:49,028 --> 04:48:50,612
Hey, McFly!

4107
04:48:52,031 --> 04:48:54,116
I thought I told you
to stay in here!

4108
04:48:54,200 --> 04:48:57,578
Griff. Guys,
how's it going?

4109
04:48:58,580 --> 04:49:00,247
McFly!
Yeah?

4110
04:49:01,207 --> 04:49:02,666
McFly!
What?

4111
04:49:02,750 --> 04:49:04,251
Your shoe's unvelked.

4112
04:49:09,424 --> 04:49:15,053
So, McFly, have you made a decision
about tonight's opportunity?

4113
04:49:15,138 --> 04:49:17,097
Yeah, Griff. You know, I was
thinking about it. I'm not sure,

4114
04:49:17,182 --> 04:49:18,307
because I just think,
you know,

4115
04:49:18,391 --> 04:49:21,477
it might be a little
bit dangerous, so...

4116
04:49:21,561 --> 04:49:22,853
What's wrong, McFly?

4117
04:49:24,063 --> 04:49:25,814
You got no scrote?

4118
04:49:31,779 --> 04:49:32,988
He's a complete wimp.

4119
04:49:33,072 --> 04:49:36,617
What's it gonna be, McFly?
Are you in or out?

4120
04:49:37,410 --> 04:49:39,369
I just... I'm not sure
that I should.

4121
04:49:39,454 --> 04:49:42,498
You know, because I think that I
should discuss it with my father.

4122
04:49:42,582 --> 04:49:44,124
Your father?
Your father?

4123
04:49:44,209 --> 04:49:46,418
Wrong answer, McFly!
You lose!

4124
04:49:49,672 --> 04:49:52,841
Okay, Griff, I'll do it. I'll
do it, buddy. Whatever you say.

4125
04:49:52,926 --> 04:49:54,635
Stay down and shut up.

4126
04:49:56,095 --> 04:49:57,721
Keep pedaling,
you two!

4127
04:50:08,775 --> 04:50:12,778
Now, let's hear
the right answer.

4128
04:50:14,280 --> 04:50:15,447
Well!

4129
04:50:16,032 --> 04:50:18,951
Since when did you become
the physical type?

4130
04:50:19,035 --> 04:50:20,744
The answer's no, Griff.

4131
04:50:21,287 --> 04:50:22,329
No?

4132
04:50:22,413 --> 04:50:23,539
Yeah. What are you,
deaf and stupid?

4133
04:50:23,623 --> 04:50:25,290
I said no!

4134
04:50:25,375 --> 04:50:27,626
What's wrong, McFly?
Chicken?

4135
04:50:33,466 --> 04:50:35,801
What did you
call me, Griff?

4136
04:50:36,970 --> 04:50:39,137
Chicken, McFly!

4137
04:50:39,222 --> 04:50:41,932
Nobody calls me

4138
04:50:44,727 --> 04:50:46,144
chicken.

4139
04:50:56,239 --> 04:50:58,156
All right, punk!
Hey, look!

4140
04:51:13,756 --> 04:51:16,091
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

4141
04:51:16,175 --> 04:51:18,594
Stop! Little girl,
little girl. Stop.

4142
04:51:18,678 --> 04:51:19,761
Hey.
Look,

4143
04:51:19,846 --> 04:51:22,598
I need to borrow
your Hoverboard.

4144
04:51:23,099 --> 04:51:24,391
Where is he?

4145
04:51:24,475 --> 04:51:25,601
Here.

4146
04:51:26,352 --> 04:51:27,728
There!

4147
04:51:33,860 --> 04:51:35,819
He's on a Hoverboard.

4148
04:51:38,281 --> 04:51:39,531
Get the boards!

4149
04:51:39,616 --> 04:51:41,199
Get McFly!

4150
04:51:48,124 --> 04:51:49,291
Get him!

4151
04:51:58,051 --> 04:52:00,052
Yeah!
Yeah, we got him!

4152
04:52:10,980 --> 04:52:13,440
There's something very
familiar about all this.

4153
04:52:46,641 --> 04:52:48,725
Hey, McFly, you bojo!

4154
04:52:48,810 --> 04:52:50,686
Those boards
don't work on water!

4155
04:52:50,770 --> 04:52:52,771
Unless you've
got power!

4156
04:53:18,464 --> 04:53:19,756
Hook on!

4157
04:53:28,766 --> 04:53:30,183
Batter up!

4158
04:53:59,547 --> 04:54:01,047
Holy shit!

4159
04:54:06,220 --> 04:54:07,721
Buttheads.

4160
04:54:20,818 --> 04:54:22,903
Drying mode on.

4161
04:54:22,987 --> 04:54:24,529
Jacket drying.

4162
04:54:27,033 --> 04:54:29,034
Your jacket is now dry.

4163
04:54:32,538 --> 04:54:34,956
Hey, kid.
Hey, little girl, thanks.

4164
04:54:35,041 --> 04:54:37,542
Keep it.
I got a Pit Bull now.

4165
04:54:37,627 --> 04:54:38,752
Come on. Let's go.

4166
04:54:38,836 --> 04:54:40,128
Save the clock tower!

4167
04:54:40,213 --> 04:54:42,380
Hey, kid.
Throw in 100 bucks, will you,

4168
04:54:42,465 --> 04:54:44,549
and help save
the clock tower.

4169
04:54:44,634 --> 04:54:46,051
Sorry, no.
Come on, kid.

4170
04:54:46,135 --> 04:54:47,636
That's an important
historical landmark!

4171
04:54:47,720 --> 04:54:48,929
Look, some other time.

4172
04:54:49,013 --> 04:54:51,723
Lightning struck
that thing 60 years ago.

4173
04:54:51,808 --> 04:54:54,935
Wait a minute.
Cubs win World Series.

4174
04:54:56,938 --> 04:54:57,979
Against Miami?

4175
04:54:58,064 --> 04:54:59,481
Yeah, it's something, huh?

4176
04:54:59,565 --> 04:55:02,108
Who would've thought?
100-1 shot!

4177
04:55:02,193 --> 04:55:04,778
I wish I could go back to
the beginning of the season,

4178
04:55:04,862 --> 04:55:06,071
put some money
on the Cubs.

4179
04:55:06,155 --> 04:55:08,365
I just meant
that Miami...

4180
04:55:09,408 --> 04:55:10,700
What did you just say?

4181
04:55:10,785 --> 04:55:13,203
I said I wish I could go back
to the beginning of the season.

4182
04:55:13,287 --> 04:55:15,622
Put some money
on the Cubbies!

4183
04:55:19,877 --> 04:55:22,963
Now this has an interesting
feature. It has a dust jacket.

4184
04:55:23,047 --> 04:55:25,340
Books used to have these
to protect the covers.

4185
04:55:25,424 --> 04:55:27,008
Of course, that was before
they had dust-repellent paper.

4186
04:55:27,093 --> 04:55:28,093
Ah.

4187
04:55:28,177 --> 04:55:29,803
And if you're
interested in dust,

4188
04:55:29,887 --> 04:55:32,764
we have a quaint little
piece from the 1980s.

4189
04:55:32,849 --> 04:55:33,932
It's called a DustBuster.

4190
04:55:38,479 --> 04:55:41,064
I can't lose.
Marty! Marty! Up here!

4191
04:55:42,275 --> 04:55:43,567
Hey, Doc,
what's going on?

4192
04:55:43,651 --> 04:55:45,443
Stand by.
I'll park over there.

4193
04:55:46,153 --> 04:55:47,821
Yeah, all right.

4194
04:55:49,782 --> 04:55:51,658
Hey, right on time.

4195
04:55:51,742 --> 04:55:53,326
Flying DeLorean.

4196
04:55:53,411 --> 04:55:55,829
I haven't seen one
of those in 30 years.

4197
04:55:56,998 --> 04:55:58,164
Sorry. Excuse me.
Sorry.

4198
04:55:59,792 --> 04:56:02,627
Hey, I'm walking here!
I'm walking here!

4199
04:56:03,546 --> 04:56:04,546
What the hell?

4200
04:56:04,630 --> 04:56:07,966
Don't drive, trank,
low-res scuzzball!

4201
04:56:09,010 --> 04:56:10,343
Two of them?

4202
04:56:10,845 --> 04:56:13,054
I left him in a suspended
animation kennel.

4203
04:56:13,139 --> 04:56:14,556
Einstein never
knew I was gone!

4204
04:56:15,766 --> 04:56:19,936
Marty! What in the name of Sir
Isaac H. Newton happened here?

4205
04:56:20,396 --> 04:56:23,773
Oh, yeah, Doc, listen, my kid
showed up. All hell broke loose.

4206
04:56:23,858 --> 04:56:25,400
Your kid?

4207
04:56:25,484 --> 04:56:28,945
Great Scott, the sleep
inducer. I was afraid of this.

4208
04:56:29,030 --> 04:56:30,238
Because I used it
on Jennifer,

4209
04:56:30,323 --> 04:56:31,323
there wasn't
enough power left

4210
04:56:31,407 --> 04:56:33,909
to knock your son out
for a full hour. Damn!

4211
04:56:33,993 --> 04:56:36,244
Doc, Doc, Doc,
look at this!

4212
04:56:36,329 --> 04:56:37,996
It's changing.

4213
04:56:50,509 --> 04:56:52,761
I was framed!

4214
04:56:52,845 --> 04:56:55,889
Yes! Yes, of course!

4215
04:56:57,058 --> 04:56:59,309
Because this Hoverboard
incident has now occurred,

4216
04:56:59,393 --> 04:57:01,269
Griff now goes to jail.

4217
04:57:01,354 --> 04:57:02,854
Therefore, your son
won't go with him tonight,

4218
04:57:02,939 --> 04:57:04,814
and that robbery
will never take place.

4219
04:57:04,899 --> 04:57:07,776
Thus, history,
future history,

4220
04:57:07,860 --> 04:57:10,236
has now been altered,
and this is the proof!

4221
04:57:10,321 --> 04:57:12,656
Marty, we've succeeded, not
exactly as I planned, but no matter.

4222
04:57:12,740 --> 04:57:14,866
Let's go get Jennifer
and go home!

4223
04:57:17,286 --> 04:57:19,204
Hi, Einie. Hi, buddy.

4224
04:57:20,831 --> 04:57:21,957
What's this?

4225
04:57:22,041 --> 04:57:23,166
It's a souvenir.

4226
04:57:23,250 --> 04:57:25,543
"50 years of
sports statistics. "

4227
04:57:25,628 --> 04:57:27,879
Hardly recreational
reading material, Marty.

4228
04:57:27,964 --> 04:57:28,964
Well, hey, Doc,
what's the harm

4229
04:57:29,048 --> 04:57:31,257
in bringing back a
little info on the future?

4230
04:57:31,342 --> 04:57:33,385
You know, maybe we could
place a couple bets.

4231
04:57:33,469 --> 04:57:37,472
Marty, I didn't invent the
time machine for financial gain!

4232
04:57:37,556 --> 04:57:40,266
The intent here is to gain a
clearer perception of humanity.

4233
04:57:40,351 --> 04:57:41,768
Where we've been,
where we're going,

4234
04:57:41,852 --> 04:57:45,021
the pitfalls and the possibilities,
the perils and the promise.

4235
04:57:45,106 --> 04:57:48,400
Perhaps even an answer to
that universal question, "Why?"

4236
04:57:48,484 --> 04:57:50,652
Hey, Doc,
I'm all for that.

4237
04:57:50,736 --> 04:57:53,238
What's wrong with making
a few bucks on the side?

4238
04:57:53,322 --> 04:57:56,825
I am going to put
this in the trash.

4239
04:57:58,744 --> 04:58:00,120
Great Scott!

4240
04:58:03,582 --> 04:58:07,836
McFly, Jennifer Jane
Parker, 3793 Oakhurst Street,

4241
04:58:07,920 --> 04:58:09,337
Hilldale, age 47.

4242
04:58:09,547 --> 04:58:12,132
Forty-seven? That's a
hell of a good face-lift.

4243
04:58:12,550 --> 04:58:13,717
What the hell are
they doing, Doc?

4244
04:58:13,801 --> 04:58:15,760
They used her thumbprint
to assess her ID.

4245
04:58:15,845 --> 04:58:17,470
Since her thumbprint never
changes over the years,

4246
04:58:17,555 --> 04:58:19,681
they simply assume she's
the Jennifer of the future.

4247
04:58:19,765 --> 04:58:20,974
Well, we gotta stop them.

4248
04:58:21,058 --> 04:58:22,726
What are we gonna say?
That we're time travelers?

4249
04:58:22,810 --> 04:58:24,060
They'd have us committed.

4250
04:58:24,145 --> 04:58:26,521
She's clean. That
means we take her home.

4251
04:58:26,605 --> 04:58:27,856
Home? To Hilldale?

4252
04:58:27,940 --> 04:58:29,899
Lt'll be dark by the
time we get out there.

4253
04:58:29,984 --> 04:58:33,361
That's it. They're taking
her home to your future home!

4254
04:58:33,446 --> 04:58:34,654
We'll arrive
shortly thereafter,

4255
04:58:34,739 --> 04:58:36,740
get her out of there
and go back to 1985.

4256
04:58:36,824 --> 04:58:38,074
You mean I'm gonna
see where I live?

4257
04:58:38,159 --> 04:58:39,701
I'm gonna see myself
as an old man?

4258
04:58:39,785 --> 04:58:42,912
No, no, no, Marty. That could
result in... Great Scott!

4259
04:58:43,372 --> 04:58:46,124
Jennifer could conceivably
encounter her future self!

4260
04:58:46,208 --> 04:58:49,252
The consequences of that
could be disastrous!

4261
04:58:49,336 --> 04:58:50,545
Doc, what do you mean?

4262
04:58:50,629 --> 04:58:52,088
I foresee
two possibilities.

4263
04:58:52,173 --> 04:58:54,674
One, coming face to face
with herself 30 years older

4264
04:58:54,759 --> 04:58:56,885
would put her into shock,
and she'd simply pass out,

4265
04:58:56,969 --> 04:58:59,637
or two, the encounter
could create a time paradox,

4266
04:58:59,722 --> 04:59:02,390
the results of which could cause
a chain reaction that would unravel

4267
04:59:02,475 --> 04:59:04,142
the very fabric of
the space-time continuum

4268
04:59:04,226 --> 04:59:06,478
and destroy
the entire universe!

4269
04:59:06,562 --> 04:59:08,271
Granted, that's
a worst-case scenario.

4270
04:59:08,355 --> 04:59:09,981
The destruction might,
in fact, be very localized,

4271
04:59:10,066 --> 04:59:12,317
limited to
merely our own galaxy.

4272
04:59:13,194 --> 04:59:15,070
Well, that's a relief.

4273
04:59:18,991 --> 04:59:22,660
Let's go. I sure hope we find
Jennifer before she finds herself.

4274
04:59:24,288 --> 04:59:27,457
The skyway's jammed. It's gonna
take us forever to get there.

4275
04:59:27,541 --> 04:59:29,042
And this stays here.

4276
04:59:29,126 --> 04:59:31,127
I didn't invent the time
machine to win at gambling.

4277
04:59:31,212 --> 04:59:33,588
I invented a time machine
to travel through time!

4278
04:59:33,672 --> 04:59:35,673
I know. I know.
I know, Doc.

4279
04:59:44,892 --> 04:59:49,354
So, Doc Brown
invented a time machine.

4280
05:00:15,714 --> 05:00:17,215
Hilldale.

4281
05:00:18,217 --> 05:00:22,053
Nothing but a breeding ground
for tranks, lobos and zipheads.

4282
05:00:22,138 --> 05:00:24,013
Yeah, they ought to tear
this whole place down.

4283
05:00:26,475 --> 05:00:27,600
Welcome home, Jennifer.

4284
05:00:27,685 --> 05:00:28,810
Whoa!

4285
05:00:29,478 --> 05:00:30,854
You all right?
Yeah.

4286
05:00:30,938 --> 05:00:33,690
You got a little tranked,
but I think you can walk.

4287
05:00:33,774 --> 05:00:35,316
Ma'am,
you should reprogram.

4288
05:00:35,401 --> 05:00:37,318
It's dangerous to
enter without lights on.

4289
05:00:37,403 --> 05:00:38,361
Lights on?

4290
05:00:38,445 --> 05:00:39,487
Yes. Now, look.

4291
05:00:40,614 --> 05:00:43,158
Just take it easy
and you'll be fine.

4292
05:00:43,242 --> 05:00:44,909
And be careful
in the future.

4293
05:00:45,911 --> 05:00:47,412
The future?

4294
05:00:48,706 --> 05:00:50,748
Have a nice day,
Mrs. McFly.

4295
05:00:53,502 --> 05:00:56,921
Broadcasting beautiful views
24 hours a day,

4296
05:00:57,006 --> 05:00:59,257
you're tuned to
the Scenery Channel.

4297
05:01:04,597 --> 05:01:06,264
I'm in the future.

4298
05:01:18,944 --> 05:01:21,529
I get married in
the Chapel O Love?

4299
05:01:21,864 --> 05:01:24,282
Mom?
Mom, is that you?

4300
05:01:24,366 --> 05:01:26,451
I gotta get
out of here!

4301
05:01:31,040 --> 05:01:32,332
Mom!

4302
05:01:41,133 --> 05:01:43,551
Mom? Mom, is that you?

4303
05:01:48,307 --> 05:01:49,349
Grandma Lorraine!

4304
05:01:49,433 --> 05:01:50,391
Sweetheart!

4305
05:01:50,476 --> 05:01:51,643
Hi!
Hi!

4306
05:01:51,727 --> 05:01:52,727
What happened
to Grandpa?

4307
05:01:52,811 --> 05:01:54,562
Oh, he threw
his back out again.

4308
05:01:54,647 --> 05:01:56,606
How's Granddad's
little pumpkin?

4309
05:01:56,690 --> 05:01:58,066
How did you do that?
How did he do that?

4310
05:01:58,150 --> 05:02:00,568
Oh, out on the
golf course.

4311
05:02:00,653 --> 05:02:01,736
Are your folks home yet?

4312
05:02:01,820 --> 05:02:03,488
I brought pizza
for everyone.

4313
05:02:03,572 --> 05:02:04,572
Oh, who's going
to eat all that?

4314
05:02:04,657 --> 05:02:05,657
Oh, I will.

4315
05:02:05,908 --> 05:02:07,742
Damn this traffic!

4316
05:02:07,826 --> 05:02:09,744
Jennifer, that is Old Jennifer,
usually gets home around now.

4317
05:02:09,828 --> 05:02:11,371
I hope we're
not too late.

4318
05:02:15,334 --> 05:02:16,584
What is it?
What's the matter, Doc?

4319
05:02:16,669 --> 05:02:19,254
For a moment, I thought I
saw a taxi in my rear display.

4320
05:02:19,338 --> 05:02:21,506
I thought it was
following us. Weird.

4321
05:02:22,007 --> 05:02:24,759
I can't believe this
window's still broken.

4322
05:02:24,843 --> 05:02:27,595
Well, when the scenescreen
repairman called Daddy a chicken,

4323
05:02:27,680 --> 05:02:29,264
Daddy threw him
out of the house.

4324
05:02:29,348 --> 05:02:31,349
Now, we can't get
anybody to fix it.

4325
05:02:31,433 --> 05:02:33,810
Oh, look how
worn out this is.

4326
05:02:34,812 --> 05:02:37,272
Your father's
biggest problem, Marlene,

4327
05:02:37,356 --> 05:02:39,274
is that he loses
all self-control

4328
05:02:39,358 --> 05:02:41,234
when someone
calls him chicken.

4329
05:02:41,318 --> 05:02:43,111
How many times have
we heard it, George?

4330
05:02:43,195 --> 05:02:45,029
"Mom, I can't let them
think I'm chicken. "

4331
05:02:45,114 --> 05:02:46,781
"Can't let them
think I'm chicken. "

4332
05:02:46,865 --> 05:02:49,117
You're right.
Well, you're right!

4333
05:02:49,201 --> 05:02:50,618
About 30 years ago,

4334
05:02:50,703 --> 05:02:52,745
your father tried to
prove he wasn't chicken,

4335
05:02:52,830 --> 05:02:54,998
and he ended up in
an automobile accident.

4336
05:02:55,082 --> 05:02:56,416
Oh, you mean with
the Rolls-Royce?

4337
05:02:56,792 --> 05:02:58,876
Automobile accident.

4338
05:03:10,597 --> 05:03:13,224
All right, Einie,
let's find Jennifer.

4339
05:03:14,143 --> 05:03:15,685
I don't believe it.
I live in Hilldale?

4340
05:03:15,769 --> 05:03:17,312
This is great!
Way to go, McFly.

4341
05:03:17,396 --> 05:03:19,314
Marty, stay here.
Just change clothes.

4342
05:03:19,398 --> 05:03:20,398
If I need you,
I'll holler.

4343
05:03:20,482 --> 05:03:22,150
Come on, Doc, I wanna
check out my house.

4344
05:03:22,234 --> 05:03:24,152
We can't risk you running
into your older self.

4345
05:03:24,236 --> 05:03:26,070
Come on, Einie,
let's go.

4346
05:03:26,155 --> 05:03:28,573
Where's Jennifer?
Where's Jennifer?

4347
05:03:28,657 --> 05:03:30,241
Hilldale.

4348
05:03:31,285 --> 05:03:32,410
This is bitching.

4349
05:03:38,500 --> 05:03:41,210
One, seven,
four point five zero.

4350
05:03:41,295 --> 05:03:42,670
That will be $174.50.

4351
05:03:42,755 --> 05:03:43,921
Here.

4352
05:03:44,006 --> 05:03:45,757
I'd be careful, old timer.
This is a rough neighborhood.

4353
05:03:45,841 --> 05:03:47,633
Where's my receipt?
Right here. Here it is.

4354
05:03:47,718 --> 05:03:49,969
Hello. Hello.
How about a tip?

4355
05:04:04,485 --> 05:04:06,444
That accident caused
a chain reaction

4356
05:04:06,528 --> 05:04:08,613
that sent Marty's life
straight down the tubes.

4357
05:04:08,697 --> 05:04:10,698
If not for that accident,
your father's life

4358
05:04:10,783 --> 05:04:12,533
would have turned out
very differently.

4359
05:04:12,618 --> 05:04:14,702
The man in the Rolls-Royce
wouldn't have pressed charges,

4360
05:04:14,787 --> 05:04:15,953
Marty wouldn't
have broken his hand,

4361
05:04:16,038 --> 05:04:17,789
and he wouldn't have
given up on his music,

4362
05:04:17,873 --> 05:04:20,792
and he wouldn't have spent all those
years feeling sorry for himself.

4363
05:04:20,876 --> 05:04:22,460
Hey, Mom, nice pants.

4364
05:04:22,544 --> 05:04:25,546
I think the real reason your
mother married him was because

4365
05:04:25,631 --> 05:04:27,298
she felt sorry for him.
"Mom"?

4366
05:04:27,925 --> 05:04:29,217
Such a sweet girl.

4367
05:04:29,301 --> 05:04:31,219
Art off. I think maybe she deserves...

4368
05:04:31,303 --> 05:04:36,557
Okay, I want channels 18, 24, 63,
109, 87 and the Weather Channel.

4369
05:04:36,642 --> 05:04:38,226
The Weather Channel,
bringing you

4370
05:04:38,310 --> 05:04:39,560
the world's weather
24 hours a day.

4371
05:04:40,854 --> 05:04:41,896
Weather conditions
remain the same...

4372
05:04:41,980 --> 05:04:43,648
All board-certified
implant surgeons...

4373
05:04:43,732 --> 05:04:45,233
With a minor warm front...

4374
05:04:45,317 --> 05:04:46,901
Welcome home, Marty.

4375
05:04:46,985 --> 05:04:48,986
Hey, hey, hey.
Dad's home.

4376
05:04:49,405 --> 05:04:51,948
That's right. He's home. Dad's home.

4377
05:04:52,074 --> 05:04:53,991
Lord of the manor.
Hello. Hello.

4378
05:04:54,076 --> 05:04:55,118
King of the castle.

4379
05:04:55,202 --> 05:04:56,244
Hello.

4380
05:04:57,871 --> 05:04:59,747
What the hell is this?

4381
05:04:59,832 --> 05:05:01,958
Lithium mode on.

4382
05:05:02,042 --> 05:05:04,794
Yeah. That's better.
Damned kids.

4383
05:05:04,878 --> 05:05:06,796
The best...
Hey, Son.

4384
05:05:08,382 --> 05:05:10,341
Watching a little TV
for a change?

4385
05:05:22,896 --> 05:05:24,355
Son of a...

4386
05:06:04,813 --> 05:06:06,105
Hey, pizza.
I'm hungry.

4387
05:06:06,190 --> 05:06:07,356
All right.
Just wait your turn.

4388
05:06:07,441 --> 05:06:08,483
Grandma,
when it's ready,

4389
05:06:08,567 --> 05:06:10,234
could you just
shove it in my mouth?

4390
05:06:10,319 --> 05:06:12,862
Don't you be a smartass.

4391
05:06:12,946 --> 05:06:14,822
Oh, great!
The Atrocity Channel.

4392
05:06:14,907 --> 05:06:16,574
Hydrate level 4, please.

4393
05:06:21,413 --> 05:06:22,747
Mmm.

4394
05:06:23,957 --> 05:06:25,208
Is it ready?

4395
05:06:25,292 --> 05:06:26,834
Here you go.

4396
05:06:26,919 --> 05:06:28,002
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

4397
05:06:28,086 --> 05:06:30,880
Mom, you sure
can hydrate a pizza.

4398
05:06:30,964 --> 05:06:33,090
I'm sorry. I missed
that whole thing.

4399
05:06:33,175 --> 05:06:37,303
Well, I'm just worried about
Jennifer. Why isn't she home yet?

4400
05:06:37,387 --> 05:06:40,932
I'm not sure
where Jennifer is, Mom.

4401
05:06:41,016 --> 05:06:43,017
She should have
been home hours ago.

4402
05:06:43,101 --> 05:06:44,685
I'm having a hard time keeping
track of her these days.

4403
05:06:44,770 --> 05:06:47,480
Hey, fruit.
Fruit, please. Thank you.

4404
05:06:47,564 --> 05:06:49,565
She's in one of those
moods, I guess. I don't know.

4405
05:06:49,650 --> 05:06:51,317
Aren't you and Jennifer
getting along?

4406
05:06:51,401 --> 05:06:52,652
Oh, yeah.
Great, Mom.

4407
05:06:52,736 --> 05:06:55,029
We're more like a couple
of teenagers, you know.

4408
05:06:57,533 --> 05:06:59,325
Dad, telephone.
It's Needles.

4409
05:07:00,118 --> 05:07:01,536
Dad, it's for you.

4410
05:07:02,621 --> 05:07:05,540
All right. Well, I'll take
that in the den. Excuse me.

4411
05:07:05,624 --> 05:07:07,500
Retract.

4412
05:07:07,584 --> 05:07:10,628
Hello.
I'm in here, please.

4413
05:07:11,296 --> 05:07:15,633
Hey, the big M.
How's it hanging, McFly?

4414
05:07:16,343 --> 05:07:17,468
Hey, Needles.

4415
05:07:17,553 --> 05:07:18,678
Needles?

4416
05:07:18,762 --> 05:07:21,138
So, did you take look at that
little business proposal of mine?

4417
05:07:21,223 --> 05:07:22,431
I don't know, Needles.

4418
05:07:22,516 --> 05:07:24,058
What are
you afraid of?

4419
05:07:24,142 --> 05:07:27,728
If this thing works, it'll solve
all your financial problems.

4420
05:07:27,813 --> 05:07:30,940
And if it doesn't work,
Needles, I could get fired.

4421
05:07:31,024 --> 05:07:34,860
It's illegal. I mean, what if
the Jits is monitoring, huh?

4422
05:07:34,945 --> 05:07:37,071
The Jits will
never find out.

4423
05:07:37,155 --> 05:07:38,239
Oh, God.

4424
05:07:38,323 --> 05:07:42,910
Come on. Stick your card in
the slot, and I'll handle it.

4425
05:07:43,579 --> 05:07:47,665
Unless you want everyone in the
division to think you're chicken.

4426
05:07:52,212 --> 05:07:55,464
Nobody calls me chicken,
Needles.

4427
05:07:55,549 --> 05:07:56,549
Nobody!

4428
05:07:56,633 --> 05:07:57,633
All right.

4429
05:07:58,635 --> 05:07:59,844
Prove it.

4430
05:08:04,391 --> 05:08:05,891
All right.

4431
05:08:06,393 --> 05:08:08,185
All right, Needles.

4432
05:08:11,565 --> 05:08:14,859
Here's my card.
Scan it. I'm in.

4433
05:08:15,402 --> 05:08:18,362
Thanks, McFly. I'll see
you at the plant tomorrow.

4434
05:08:21,450 --> 05:08:22,783
Chicken.

4435
05:08:24,536 --> 05:08:25,911
McFly!

4436
05:08:29,374 --> 05:08:33,878
McFly, I was monitoring that
scan you just interfaced.

4437
05:08:33,962 --> 05:08:35,630
You are terminated!

4438
05:08:35,714 --> 05:08:36,964
Terminated. No!

4439
05:08:37,049 --> 05:08:39,216
No! It wasn't my fault,
sir. It was Needles.

4440
05:08:39,301 --> 05:08:40,343
Needles was
behind the whole thing.

4441
05:08:40,427 --> 05:08:41,427
And you cooperated.

4442
05:08:41,553 --> 05:08:43,679
No, I didn't. It was a sting
operation. It was illegal.

4443
05:08:43,764 --> 05:08:45,056
I was setting him up.

4444
05:08:45,140 --> 05:08:46,807
And you knew.
McFly, read my fax!

4445
05:08:46,892 --> 05:08:51,020
No! Please, no. I cannot
be fired. I'm fired.

4446
05:09:02,240 --> 05:09:04,742
Oh, this is heavy.

4447
05:09:05,577 --> 05:09:08,162
What am I going
to tell Jennifer?

4448
05:09:08,246 --> 05:09:09,914
Jennifer. Jennifer.

4449
05:09:10,248 --> 05:09:12,583
Oh, Doc, am I glad
to see you.

4450
05:09:13,085 --> 05:09:16,170
Go out the front door.
I'll meet you there.

4451
05:09:16,254 --> 05:09:18,756
But it doesn't open.
There's no doorknob.

4452
05:09:18,840 --> 05:09:21,050
Press your thumb
to the plate.

4453
05:09:21,134 --> 05:09:23,010
What plate?

4454
05:09:37,109 --> 05:09:39,151
Marty, what does
this fax mean?

4455
05:09:39,236 --> 05:09:42,363
Oh, Mom, it's a joke, an
office joke. Kind of a joke fax.

4456
05:09:42,447 --> 05:09:43,698
Marty, I heard you yelling.

4457
05:09:43,782 --> 05:09:45,574
Mom, Mom, Mom,
calm down.

4458
05:09:45,659 --> 05:09:47,952
I wasn't yelling. Needles and
I were just kind of joking.

4459
05:09:48,036 --> 05:09:49,161
Welcome home, Jennifer.

4460
05:09:49,246 --> 05:09:50,246
Marty,
have you lost your job?

4461
05:09:50,330 --> 05:09:52,832
Lost my job, Mom? Get out
of town. Look, you know...

4462
05:09:57,671 --> 05:09:59,714
I'm young!
I'm old!

4463
05:10:08,974 --> 05:10:10,558
Marty! Marty!

4464
05:10:10,642 --> 05:10:12,685
Marty, come quick!
Quick!

4465
05:10:28,326 --> 05:10:29,660
She encountered
her older self

4466
05:10:29,745 --> 05:10:32,288
and went into shock,
just as I predicted.

4467
05:10:32,372 --> 05:10:33,831
She'll be fine.

4468
05:10:33,915 --> 05:10:36,083
Let's get her back
to 1985,

4469
05:10:36,168 --> 05:10:38,961
and then I'm gonna destroy
the time machine.

4470
05:10:39,045 --> 05:10:40,129
Destroy it?

4471
05:10:40,213 --> 05:10:41,922
What about that
stuff about humanity,

4472
05:10:42,007 --> 05:10:43,632
where we're going
and why?

4473
05:10:43,717 --> 05:10:46,260
The risks are just too great,
as this incident proves.

4474
05:10:46,344 --> 05:10:47,595
And I was
behaving responsibly.

4475
05:10:47,679 --> 05:10:48,971
You can imagine
the danger

4476
05:10:49,055 --> 05:10:51,098
if the time machine were to
fall into the wrong hands.

4477
05:10:54,352 --> 05:10:56,687
My only regret is that
I'll never get a chance

4478
05:10:56,772 --> 05:10:59,231
to visit my favorite
historical era,

4479
05:10:59,441 --> 05:11:00,858
the Old West.

4480
05:11:01,234 --> 05:11:04,987
But time traveling
is just too dangerous.

4481
05:11:05,071 --> 05:11:07,990
Better that I devote
myself to studying

4482
05:11:08,074 --> 05:11:10,993
the other great mystery
of the universe,

4483
05:11:13,330 --> 05:11:14,538
women.

4484
05:11:16,541 --> 05:11:20,211
Marty, Einie, brace yourselves
for temporal displacement.

4485
05:11:30,597 --> 05:11:32,223
Did we make it?

4486
05:11:36,144 --> 05:11:37,520
Are we back?

4487
05:11:44,361 --> 05:11:45,402
We're back.

4488
05:12:06,299 --> 05:12:07,675
Let's put her
in the swing.

4489
05:12:07,759 --> 05:12:09,051
Then I'll take you home,
and you can come back

4490
05:12:09,135 --> 05:12:11,053
in your truck
and wake her.

4491
05:12:11,137 --> 05:12:13,597
When she awakens here in
her own house and it's dark,

4492
05:12:13,682 --> 05:12:16,433
you should be able to convince
her that it was all a dream.

4493
05:12:16,518 --> 05:12:17,685
Wait a minute.
We're just gonna

4494
05:12:17,769 --> 05:12:19,270
leave her here
on the porch?

4495
05:12:19,354 --> 05:12:22,606
The disorientation will help
convince her that it was all a dream.

4496
05:12:22,691 --> 05:12:24,567
How long do you think
she's gonna be out?

4497
05:12:24,651 --> 05:12:27,194
I'm not quite sure. She
received quite a shock.

4498
05:12:27,279 --> 05:12:28,487
Could be for
a few minutes.

4499
05:12:28,572 --> 05:12:30,906
Most probably,
a couple of hours.

4500
05:12:30,991 --> 05:12:32,700
You better bring smelling
salts back with you.

4501
05:12:32,784 --> 05:12:34,076
You're the doc, Doc.

4502
05:12:34,160 --> 05:12:35,202
All right. Come on.
Let's go, Einie.

4503
05:12:37,998 --> 05:12:40,040
Don't worry.
She'll be fine.

4504
05:12:41,126 --> 05:12:43,836
I don't remember bars
being on these windows.

4505
05:13:00,520 --> 05:13:03,606
If you need me, I'll be back at
my lab dismantling this thing.

4506
05:13:03,690 --> 05:13:04,899
Right.

4507
05:13:22,250 --> 05:13:23,918
What the hell?

4508
05:13:41,770 --> 05:13:43,479
Hey. Hey, wait.
Wait a minute.

4509
05:13:43,563 --> 05:13:45,272
What are
you doing in my room?

4510
05:13:45,357 --> 05:13:46,440
Help! Rape! Mom!

4511
05:13:46,524 --> 05:13:47,524
Okay. Okay.

4512
05:13:47,609 --> 05:13:49,109
Dad, help!

4513
05:13:49,194 --> 05:13:50,361
Freeze, sucker!

4514
05:13:50,487 --> 05:13:52,029
He jumped me! Hey, it's okay.
I don't want any trouble.

4515
05:13:52,113 --> 05:13:53,113
He came through
the window!

4516
05:13:53,198 --> 05:13:55,032
You got trouble now,
you piece of trash.

4517
05:13:55,700 --> 05:13:57,034
What are you doing in here
with my daughter?

4518
05:13:57,118 --> 05:13:58,494
Hey, listen, I'm just
in the wrong house.

4519
05:13:58,578 --> 05:14:01,038
You got that right,
you little son of a...

4520
05:14:01,539 --> 05:14:02,748
Hey, look,
I made a mistake.

4521
05:14:02,832 --> 05:14:05,542
Damn right you
made a mistake!

4522
05:14:05,627 --> 05:14:06,627
Kill him!

4523
05:14:06,711 --> 05:14:08,545
I'm gonna tear
your ass up!

4524
05:14:08,630 --> 05:14:10,756
That's right.
You keep running, sucker!

4525
05:14:10,840 --> 05:14:12,132
And you tell
that realty company

4526
05:14:12,217 --> 05:14:13,759
that I ain't selling!
You hear?

4527
05:14:13,843 --> 05:14:15,803
We ain't gonna
be terrorized!

4528
05:14:57,929 --> 05:15:00,347
This has gotta
be the wrong year.

4529
05:15:18,450 --> 05:15:19,825
1985?

4530
05:15:21,369 --> 05:15:22,411
It can't be.

4531
05:15:22,495 --> 05:15:23,495
Drop it.

4532
05:15:27,292 --> 05:15:30,044
So you're the son of a bitch
who's been stealing my newspapers.

4533
05:15:30,128 --> 05:15:31,503
Mr. Strickland.

4534
05:15:32,047 --> 05:15:34,506
Mr. Strickland. It's
me, sir. It's Marty.

4535
05:15:34,591 --> 05:15:35,591
Who?

4536
05:15:35,675 --> 05:15:36,884
It's Marty McFly.
Marty McFly.

4537
05:15:36,968 --> 05:15:38,552
Don't you know me, sir?
From school, sir.

4538
05:15:38,636 --> 05:15:39,887
I've never seen you
before in my life,

4539
05:15:39,971 --> 05:15:41,680
but you look to
me like a slacker.

4540
05:15:41,765 --> 05:15:44,058
Yeah, that's right. That's
right. I am a slacker.

4541
05:15:44,142 --> 05:15:46,226
Don't you remember? You
gave me detention last week.

4542
05:15:46,311 --> 05:15:49,063
Last week? The school
burned down six years ago.

4543
05:15:49,147 --> 05:15:50,230
Now, you got
exactly three seconds

4544
05:15:50,315 --> 05:15:51,899
to get off my porch
with your nuts intact.

4545
05:15:51,983 --> 05:15:53,901
One.
Please, Mr. Strickland,

4546
05:15:53,985 --> 05:15:55,444
I just want to know what
the hell's going on here.

4547
05:15:55,528 --> 05:15:56,528
Two.

4548
05:15:57,697 --> 05:15:58,739
Hey, Strickland!

4549
05:15:58,823 --> 05:15:59,823
Yeah!

4550
05:16:17,425 --> 05:16:19,176
Eat lead, slackers!

4551
05:16:26,267 --> 05:16:30,229
Watch where you're going,
crazy drunk pedestrian.

4552
05:16:30,688 --> 05:16:32,022
Red.

4553
05:17:28,371 --> 05:17:29,913
Ladies and gentlemen,

4554
05:17:29,998 --> 05:17:32,499
welcome to
the Biff Tannen Museum.

4555
05:17:32,584 --> 05:17:35,169

number one citizen

4556
05:17:35,253 --> 05:17:37,671
and America's
greatest living folk hero,

the one and only
Biff Tannen.

4558
05:17:40,925 --> 05:17:44,595
Of course, we've all heard
the legend, but who is the man?

4559
05:17:44,679 --> 05:17:45,929
Inside, you will learn

4560

and most powerful men
in America.

4564
05:17:56,316 --> 05:17:58,025
fastest gun in the West.

4565
05:17:58,109 --> 05:17:59,610
See Biff's
humble beginnings

4566
05:17:59,694 --> 05:18:01,278
and how a trip
to the racetrack

4567
05:18:01,362 --> 05:18:05,240
on his 21 st birthday made
him a millionaire overnight.

4568
05:18:08,494 --> 05:18:11,246
Share in the excitement
of a fabulous winning streak

4569
05:18:11,331 --> 05:18:15,125

"The Luckiest Man on Earth. "

4570
05:18:15,210 --> 05:18:17,794
Learn how Biff parlayed
that lucky winning streak

4571
05:18:17,879 --> 05:18:20,047
into the vast empire
called Biffco.

4572
05:18:20,131 --> 05:18:24,593
Discover how in 1979, Biff successfully
lobbied to legalize gambling

4573
05:18:24,677 --> 05:18:27,346
and turned Hill Valley's
dilapidated courthouse

4574
05:18:27,430 --> 05:18:30,057
into a beautiful
casino hotel.

4575
05:18:30,141 --> 05:18:33,894
I just want to say one
thing. God bless America!

4576
05:18:34,812 --> 05:18:36,897
Meet the women
who shared in his passion

4577
05:18:36,981 --> 05:18:38,815
as he searched
for true love,

4578
05:18:39,525 --> 05:18:41,235
and relive
Biff's happiest moment

4579
05:18:41,319 --> 05:18:44,905
as, in 1973, he realized
his life-long romantic dream

4580
05:18:44,989 --> 05:18:47,950
by marrying his high school
sweetheart, Lorraine Baines McFly.

4581
05:18:48,034 --> 05:18:49,076
How's it feel,
Mr. Tannen?

4582
05:18:49,160 --> 05:18:50,786
Third time's
the charm.

4583
05:18:53,581 --> 05:18:57,960
No! No!

4584
05:18:58,044 --> 05:18:59,294
Hey, you're coming
with us upstairs.

4585
05:18:59,379 --> 05:19:00,420
Let me go.

4586
05:19:00,505 --> 05:19:03,048
Look, sonny, we can do this
the easy way or the hard way.

4587
05:19:03,591 --> 05:19:05,342
The easy way.

4588
05:19:12,016 --> 05:19:15,102
Mom? Mom, is that you?

4589
05:19:15,186 --> 05:19:16,687
Just relax, Marty.

4590
05:19:17,563 --> 05:19:20,607
You've been asleep
for almost two hours.

4591
05:19:22,277 --> 05:19:25,529
I had a horrible nightmare.
It was terrible.

4592
05:19:25,989 --> 05:19:29,199
Well, you're safe
and sound now,

4593
05:19:29,284 --> 05:19:31,868
back on the good
old 27th floor.

4594
05:19:32,829 --> 05:19:34,746
Twenty-seventh floor!

4595
05:19:40,378 --> 05:19:43,171
Mom?
Mom, that can't be you.

4596
05:19:43,965 --> 05:19:46,967
Well, yes, it's me,
Marty. Are you all right?

4597
05:19:47,051 --> 05:19:50,971
I'm fine. I'm fine. It's just
that you're so... You're so

4598
05:19:51,973 --> 05:19:53,223
big.

4599
05:19:53,850 --> 05:19:56,310
Oh. Everything's gonna be
fine, Marty. Are you hungry?

4600
05:19:56,394 --> 05:19:58,020
I can call room service.

4601
05:20:00,064 --> 05:20:01,398
Room service?

4602
05:20:01,482 --> 05:20:03,150
Lorraine!

4603
05:20:03,234 --> 05:20:04,818
Oh, my God.
It's your father.

4604
05:20:04,902 --> 05:20:06,069
My father?

4605
05:20:08,156 --> 05:20:10,907
You're supposed to be in Switzerland,
you little son of a bitch!

4606
05:20:10,992 --> 05:20:12,159
My father!

4607
05:20:12,243 --> 05:20:14,202
Did you get kicked out
of another boarding school?

4608
05:20:14,287 --> 05:20:16,788
Damn it, Lorraine. Do you know
how much perfectly good dough

4609
05:20:16,873 --> 05:20:18,498
I've blown on this
no-good kid of yours, huh?

4610
05:20:18,583 --> 05:20:19,583
On all three of them?

4611
05:20:19,667 --> 05:20:22,753
What the hell do you
care? We can afford it.

4612
05:20:23,296 --> 05:20:25,005
The least we can do
with all that money

4613
05:20:25,089 --> 05:20:27,132
is provide a better life
for our children.

4614
05:20:27,216 --> 05:20:28,508
Hold on one second.

4615
05:20:28,593 --> 05:20:31,678
Let's get this straight.
Marty is your kid, not mine.

4616
05:20:31,763 --> 05:20:32,888
And all the money
in the world

4617
05:20:32,972 --> 05:20:34,806
wouldn't do jack shit
for that lazy bum.

4618
05:20:34,891 --> 05:20:37,017
Stop it, Biff.
Just stop it.

4619
05:20:37,101 --> 05:20:40,562
Look at him. He's a butthead,
just like his old man was.

4620
05:20:43,483 --> 05:20:47,110
Don't you dare speak
that way about George.

4621
05:20:48,696 --> 05:20:51,031
You're not even
half the man he was.

4622
05:20:52,909 --> 05:20:55,035
You son of a bitch!
Hey.

4623
05:20:59,707 --> 05:21:02,042
Always
the little hothead, huh?

4624
05:21:08,007 --> 05:21:10,133
You wanna
take a poke at me?

4625
05:21:13,554 --> 05:21:16,348
Damn it, Biff.
That's it. I'm leaving.

4626
05:21:17,517 --> 05:21:20,143
So go ahead. But think
about this, Lorraine!

4627
05:21:20,311 --> 05:21:22,229
Who's gonna pay for
all your clothes, huh?

4628
05:21:22,313 --> 05:21:24,147
And your jewelry
and your liquor?

4629
05:21:24,232 --> 05:21:27,401
Who's gonna pay for your
cosmetic surgery, Lorraine?

4630
05:21:27,485 --> 05:21:30,862
You were the one who wanted
me to get these things.

4631
05:21:31,489 --> 05:21:34,241
If you want them back,
you can have them.

4632
05:21:34,325 --> 05:21:36,618
Look, Lorraine.
You walk out that door,

4633
05:21:36,702 --> 05:21:39,746
and I won't only cut off
you. I'll cut off your kids.

4634
05:21:40,498 --> 05:21:41,540
You wouldn't.

4635
05:21:41,624 --> 05:21:42,582
Wouldn't I?

4636
05:21:42,667 --> 05:21:43,917
First your daughter,
Linda.

4637
05:21:44,001 --> 05:21:45,877
I'll cancel all
her credit cards.

4638
05:21:45,962 --> 05:21:48,463
She can settle her debts
with the bank all by herself.

4639
05:21:48,548 --> 05:21:51,675
Your idiot son, Dave. I'll
get his probation revoked.

4640
05:21:51,759 --> 05:21:53,844
And as for Marty.

4641
05:21:53,928 --> 05:21:56,763
Well, maybe you'd like to have
all three of your kids behind bars,

4642
05:21:56,848 --> 05:21:58,932
just like
your brother Joey.

4643
05:21:59,016 --> 05:22:01,685
One big, happy,
jailbird family.

4644
05:22:04,439 --> 05:22:08,024
All right, Biff.
You win. I'll stay.

4645
05:22:11,696 --> 05:22:15,615
As for you, I'll be back up here
in an hour, so you better not be.

4646
05:22:26,919 --> 05:22:29,504
He was right,
and I was wrong.

4647
05:22:31,883 --> 05:22:33,592
Mom!

4648
05:22:33,676 --> 05:22:34,759
Mom,
what are you saying?

4649
05:22:34,844 --> 05:22:36,553
You're actually
defending him.

4650
05:22:36,637 --> 05:22:39,097
I had it coming.
He's my husband,

4651
05:22:39,182 --> 05:22:41,099
and he takes care
of all of us,

4652
05:22:41,726 --> 05:22:43,435
and he deserves
our respect.

4653
05:22:43,519 --> 05:22:44,728
Respect?

4654
05:22:45,480 --> 05:22:49,232
Your husband! How could
he be your husband?

4655
05:22:49,775 --> 05:22:51,818
How could you
leave Dad for him?

4656
05:22:51,903 --> 05:22:53,153
Leave Dad?

4657
05:22:53,237 --> 05:22:55,280
Marty, are you
feeling all right?

4658
05:22:55,364 --> 05:22:57,824
No. No, I'm not
feeling all right!

4659
05:22:57,909 --> 05:23:00,452
I don't understand one damn
thing that's going on around here,

4660
05:23:00,536 --> 05:23:03,413
and why nobody can give me
a simple, straight answer.

4661
05:23:03,664 --> 05:23:06,541
Oh, they must have hit you
over the head hard this time.

4662
05:23:06,626 --> 05:23:09,711
Mom, I just want
to know one thing.

4663
05:23:09,795 --> 05:23:12,797
Where's my father?
Where's George McFly?

4664
05:23:14,258 --> 05:23:17,844
Marty, George,
your father

4665
05:23:17,929 --> 05:23:21,056
is in the same place he's
been for the past 12 years.

4666
05:23:23,434 --> 05:23:25,393
Oak Park Cemetery.

4667
05:23:51,128 --> 05:23:52,462
No.

4668
05:23:55,049 --> 05:23:57,801
No! This can't
be happening!

4669
05:23:58,886 --> 05:24:01,137
"March 15, 1973."

4670
05:24:01,222 --> 05:24:04,391
No! Please, God, no!

4671
05:24:05,851 --> 05:24:08,520
No, please, God.
Please, God, no.

4672
05:24:08,604 --> 05:24:11,940
This can't be happening.

4673
05:24:13,651 --> 05:24:15,151
This can't be...

4674
05:24:15,236 --> 05:24:17,696
I'm afraid it is
happening, Marty. All of it.

4675
05:24:18,155 --> 05:24:19,281
Doc!

4676
05:24:19,365 --> 05:24:20,699
When I learned
about your father,

4677
05:24:20,783 --> 05:24:22,242
I figured
you'd come here.

4678
05:24:24,787 --> 05:24:27,455
Then you know
what happened to him?

4679
05:24:28,958 --> 05:24:34,796
Do you know what
happened March 15, 1973?

4680
05:24:36,716 --> 05:24:38,383
Yes, Marty. I know.

4681
05:24:39,343 --> 05:24:40,427
I went
to the public library

4682
05:24:40,511 --> 05:24:42,429
to try to make sense
out of all the madness.

4683
05:24:42,513 --> 05:24:43,972
The place was
boarded up, shut down,

4684
05:24:44,056 --> 05:24:45,974
so I broke in and
borrowed some newspapers.

4685
05:24:46,058 --> 05:24:47,517
I don't get it, Doc.

4686
05:24:47,727 --> 05:24:49,686
I mean, how can all
this be happening?

4687
05:24:49,770 --> 05:24:51,229
It's like we're in
hell or something.

4688
05:24:51,314 --> 05:24:54,316
No, it's Hill Valley. Although, I
can't imagine hell being much worse.

4689
05:24:56,402 --> 05:24:59,112
Oh, Einie.
I'm sorry, boy.

4690
05:24:59,864 --> 05:25:03,199
The lab is an awful,
awful, awful, awful mess.

4691
05:25:04,493 --> 05:25:05,869
Attaboy.

4692
05:25:06,579 --> 05:25:09,789
Obviously, the time
continuum has been disrupted,

4693
05:25:09,874 --> 05:25:12,292
creating this new
temporal event sequence

4694
05:25:12,376 --> 05:25:14,127
resulting in this
alternate reality.

4695
05:25:14,211 --> 05:25:15,253
English, Doc.

4696
05:25:15,338 --> 05:25:17,631
Here, here, here.
Let me illustrate.

4697
05:25:22,345 --> 05:25:26,473
Imagine that this line
represents time.

4698
05:25:26,557 --> 05:25:31,353
Here's the present, 1985,
the future and the past.

4699
05:25:33,105 --> 05:25:36,232
Prior to this point in
time, somewhere in the past,

4700
05:25:36,317 --> 05:25:38,777
the timeline skewed
into this tangent

4701
05:25:38,861 --> 05:25:41,863
creating
an alternate 1985.

4702
05:25:41,947 --> 05:25:45,742
Alternate to you,
me and Einstein,

4703
05:25:46,243 --> 05:25:49,287
but reality for
everyone else.

4704
05:25:53,584 --> 05:25:55,418
Recognize this?

4705
05:25:55,670 --> 05:25:57,712
It's the bag
the sports book came in.

4706
05:25:57,797 --> 05:26:00,674
I know, because the
receipt was still inside.

4707
05:26:00,758 --> 05:26:04,678
I found them in the time
machine along with this.

4708
05:26:10,267 --> 05:26:12,352
It's the top
of Biff's cane.

4709
05:26:12,436 --> 05:26:14,020
I mean,
Old Biff from the future.

4710
05:26:14,105 --> 05:26:16,064
Correct. It was
in the time machine

4711
05:26:16,148 --> 05:26:20,443
because Biff was in the time
machine with the sports almanac.

4712
05:26:21,112 --> 05:26:22,195
Holy shit.

4713
05:26:22,279 --> 05:26:25,115
You see, while we were in the future,

4714
05:26:25,199 --> 05:26:26,658
Biff got
the sports book,

4715
05:26:26,742 --> 05:26:29,077
stole the time machine,
went back in time,

4716
05:26:29,161 --> 05:26:32,539
and gave the book to himself
at some point in the past.

4717
05:26:32,832 --> 05:26:37,001
Look. It says right here

4718
05:26:37,086 --> 05:26:39,254
that Biff made
his first million

4719
05:26:39,338 --> 05:26:42,298
betting on a horse race
in 1958.

4720
05:26:42,925 --> 05:26:44,217
He wasn't just lucky.

4721
05:26:44,301 --> 05:26:47,804
He knew because he had all the
race results in the sports almanac.

4722
05:26:48,055 --> 05:26:50,765
That's how he made
his entire fortune.

4723
05:26:51,475 --> 05:26:53,810
Look at his pocket
with a magnifying glass.

4724
05:26:56,272 --> 05:26:57,814
The almanac.

4725
05:26:58,649 --> 05:27:01,025
Son of a bitch
stole my idea.

4726
05:27:01,861 --> 05:27:04,154
He must have been
listening when I...

4727
05:27:06,115 --> 05:27:09,325
It's my fault. The
whole thing is my fault.

4728
05:27:09,410 --> 05:27:11,411
If I hadn't bought
that damn book,

4729
05:27:11,495 --> 05:27:13,037
none of this would
have ever happened.

4730
05:27:13,122 --> 05:27:14,247
Well, it's all
in the past.

4731
05:27:14,331 --> 05:27:15,415
You mean the future?

4732
05:27:15,499 --> 05:27:18,376
Whatever.
It demonstrates precisely

4733
05:27:18,461 --> 05:27:20,253
how time travel
can be misused

4734
05:27:20,337 --> 05:27:23,465
and why the time machine
must be destroyed

4735
05:27:23,549 --> 05:27:25,925
after we straighten
all of this out.

4736
05:27:26,010 --> 05:27:28,094
Right. So we go
back to the future,

4737
05:27:28,179 --> 05:27:30,305
and we stop Biff from
stealing the time machine.

4738
05:27:30,389 --> 05:27:32,932
We can't,
because if we travel

4739
05:27:33,017 --> 05:27:35,477
into the future from
this point in time,

4740
05:27:35,561 --> 05:27:39,105
it will be the future
of this reality,

4741
05:27:39,899 --> 05:27:43,067
in which Biff is
corrupt and powerful

4742
05:27:43,152 --> 05:27:45,069
and married
to your mother

4743
05:27:45,154 --> 05:27:50,033
and in which this
has happened to me.

4744
05:27:55,539 --> 05:28:00,418
No. Our only chance to repair
the present is in the past

4745
05:28:00,503 --> 05:28:04,631
at the point where the timeline
skewed into this tangent.

4746
05:28:04,715 --> 05:28:08,802
In order to put the universe
back as we remember it

4747
05:28:08,886 --> 05:28:11,221
and get back
to our reality,

4748
05:28:11,305 --> 05:28:13,139
we have to find
out the exact date

4749
05:28:13,224 --> 05:28:15,016
and the specific
circumstances

4750
05:28:15,100 --> 05:28:17,936
of how, where
and when Young Biff

4751
05:28:18,020 --> 05:28:20,438
got his hands on
that sports almanac.

4752
05:28:23,234 --> 05:28:24,400
I'll ask him.

4753
05:28:48,050 --> 05:28:52,220
Bulletproof vest! Great
flick! Great frigging flick!

4754
05:28:52,513 --> 05:28:54,597
The guy is brilliant.

4755
05:28:55,099 --> 05:28:56,724
Hey, what the hell's
going...

4756
05:28:56,851 --> 05:28:59,352
Hey! What the hell
are you doing in here?

4757
05:28:59,436 --> 05:29:00,603
Party's over, Biff.

4758
05:29:02,481 --> 05:29:03,773
Sorry, ladies.

4759
05:29:03,858 --> 05:29:06,609
How did you get past
my security downstairs?

4760
05:29:07,278 --> 05:29:08,987
There's a little matter
we need to talk about.

4761
05:29:09,071 --> 05:29:11,406
Yeah. Money, right?
Well, forget it.

4762
05:29:11,490 --> 05:29:13,366
No. Not money.

4763
05:29:15,286 --> 05:29:18,746
Gray's Sports Almanac.

4764
05:29:22,167 --> 05:29:24,127
You heard him, girls.

4765
05:29:24,628 --> 05:29:26,087
Party's over.

4766
05:29:27,298 --> 05:29:30,800
Start talking, kid. What
else you know about that book?

4767
05:29:32,511 --> 05:29:35,305
First, you tell me
how you got it.

4768
05:29:35,806 --> 05:29:39,058
How, where and when.

4769
05:29:41,478 --> 05:29:43,813
All right.
Take a seat.

4770
05:29:47,818 --> 05:29:49,152
Sit down!

4771
05:29:53,324 --> 05:29:56,117
November 12, 1955.
That was when.

4772
05:29:56,201 --> 05:29:59,370
November 12, 1955. That
was the date I went back...

4773
05:30:00,664 --> 05:30:04,709
That was the date of the famous
Hill Valley lightning storm.

4774
05:30:05,878 --> 05:30:08,546
You know your history.
Very good.

4775
05:30:09,506 --> 05:30:11,257
I'll never forget
that Saturday.

4776
05:30:11,342 --> 05:30:13,051
I'd just picked
my car up from the shop,

4777
05:30:13,135 --> 05:30:16,304
'cause I'd rolled it in a
drag race a few days earlier.

4778
05:30:16,388 --> 05:30:19,015
I thought you crashed
into a manure truck.

4779
05:30:20,392 --> 05:30:22,977
How do you know
about that?

4780
05:30:23,062 --> 05:30:24,854
My father told me
about it.

4781
05:30:24,939 --> 05:30:26,189
Your father?

4782
05:30:27,441 --> 05:30:29,359
Before he died.

4783
05:30:30,402 --> 05:30:31,903
Yeah. Right.

4784
05:30:33,113 --> 05:30:35,990
So there I was,
minding my own business.

4785
05:30:36,075 --> 05:30:39,369
This crazy old codger
with a cane shows up.

4786
05:30:39,453 --> 05:30:41,454
He says he's my
distant relative.

4787
05:30:41,538 --> 05:30:43,206
I don't see
any resemblance.

4788
05:30:45,209 --> 05:30:48,044
So he says, "How would
you like to be rich?"

4789
05:30:48,629 --> 05:30:50,505
So I said, "Sure. "

4790
05:30:55,260 --> 05:30:57,303
So he lays
this book on me.

4791
05:30:57,388 --> 05:30:59,138
He says this book
will tell me the outcome

4792
05:30:59,223 --> 05:31:01,891
of every sporting event
till the end of the century.

4793
05:31:01,976 --> 05:31:05,436
All I have to do is bet on the
winner, and I'll never lose.

4794
05:31:08,649 --> 05:31:10,191
So I said,
"What's the catch?"

4795
05:31:10,275 --> 05:31:13,361
He says, "No catch.
Just keep it a secret. "

4796
05:31:17,449 --> 05:31:19,993
After that,
he disappeared.

4797
05:31:20,077 --> 05:31:21,411
I never saw him again.

4798
05:31:34,133 --> 05:31:36,342
Oh, and he told me
one more thing.

4799
05:31:36,427 --> 05:31:39,178
He said, "Someday a
crazy, wild-eyed scientist,

4800
05:31:39,263 --> 05:31:42,724
"or a kid may show up
asking about that book.

4801
05:31:42,808 --> 05:31:45,018
"And if that
ever happens... "

4802
05:31:50,107 --> 05:31:53,443
Funny. I never
thought it would be you.

4803
05:31:54,361 --> 05:31:56,070
Yeah, well, Biff, you're
forgetting one thing.

4804
05:31:56,155 --> 05:31:57,947
What the hell is that?

4805
05:32:03,787 --> 05:32:06,831
You're dead,
you little son of a bitch!

4806
05:32:19,053 --> 05:32:20,053
Hey, there he is!

4807
05:32:20,137 --> 05:32:21,345
Hey, hey!

4808
05:32:36,278 --> 05:32:37,570
Oh, yeah!

4809
05:33:03,555 --> 05:33:06,224
Go ahead, kid. Jump.

4810
05:33:06,975 --> 05:33:09,769
A suicide will
be nice and neat.

4811
05:33:09,853 --> 05:33:11,521
What if I don't?

4812
05:33:12,439 --> 05:33:14,190
Lead poisoning.

4813
05:33:14,274 --> 05:33:16,150
What about
the police, Biff?

4814
05:33:16,235 --> 05:33:18,694
They're gonna match up
the bullet with that gun.

4815
05:33:18,779 --> 05:33:20,863
Kid, I own the police.

4816
05:33:22,866 --> 05:33:25,034
Besides,
they couldn't match up

4817
05:33:25,119 --> 05:33:27,203
the bullet that
killed your old man.

4818
05:33:27,663 --> 05:33:29,038
You son of a...

4819
05:33:31,500 --> 05:33:33,918
I suppose it's
poetic justice.

4820
05:33:34,753 --> 05:33:38,881
Two McFlys
with the same gun.

4821
05:33:50,227 --> 05:33:51,227
Idiot.

4822
05:33:56,233 --> 05:33:57,483
What the hell?

4823
05:34:02,447 --> 05:34:03,948
Nice shot, Doc!

4824
05:34:05,492 --> 05:34:07,160
You're not
gonna believe this.

4825
05:34:07,244 --> 05:34:09,078
We gotta
go back to 1955.

4826
05:34:09,163 --> 05:34:10,830
I don't believe it.

4827
05:34:22,426 --> 05:34:24,677
That's right, Doc.
November 12, 1955.

4828
05:34:24,761 --> 05:34:28,347
Unbelievable that Old Biff could've
chosen that particular date.

4829
05:34:28,432 --> 05:34:29,473
It could mean that
that point in time

4830
05:34:29,558 --> 05:34:32,185
inherently contains some
sort of cosmic significance,

4831
05:34:32,269 --> 05:34:34,187
almost as if it were
the temporal junction point

4832
05:34:34,271 --> 05:34:36,439
for the entire
space-time continuum.

4833
05:34:36,523 --> 05:34:39,400
On the other hand, it could
just be an amazing coincidence.

4834
05:34:42,196 --> 05:34:44,864
Damn!
Got to fix that thing.

4835
05:34:44,948 --> 05:34:46,324
All right.
Time circuits on.

4836
05:34:47,367 --> 05:34:49,452
What do you mean,
time circuits on?

4837
05:34:49,536 --> 05:34:51,162
Doc, we're not
going back now.

4838
05:34:51,246 --> 05:34:52,288
Yep.

4839
05:34:52,372 --> 05:34:54,123
Doc, what about Jennifer?
What about Einstein?

4840
05:34:54,208 --> 05:34:55,583
We can't just
leave them here.

4841
05:34:55,667 --> 05:34:57,793
Don't worry, Marty. Assuming
we succeed in our mission,

4842
05:34:57,878 --> 05:35:01,380
this alternate 1985 will be
changed back into the real 1985,

4843
05:35:01,465 --> 05:35:04,717
instantaneously transforming
around Jennifer and Einie.

4844
05:35:04,801 --> 05:35:06,344
Jennifer and Einie
will be fine,

4845
05:35:06,428 --> 05:35:09,180
and they will have absolutely
no memory of this horrible place.

4846
05:35:09,306 --> 05:35:10,723
Doc.

4847
05:35:11,308 --> 05:35:13,142
What if we don't succeed?

4848
05:35:13,894 --> 05:35:15,311
We must succeed.

4849
05:35:29,743 --> 05:35:33,246
This is heavy, Doc. I mean, it's
like I was just here yesterday.

4850
05:35:33,330 --> 05:35:35,081
You were here yesterday,
Marty. You were.

4851
05:35:35,165 --> 05:35:36,415
Amazing, isn't it?

4852
05:35:36,500 --> 05:35:39,669
All right, sunrise should
be in about 22 minutes.

4853
05:35:39,753 --> 05:35:43,047
You go into town. Track
down Young Biff and tail him.

4854
05:35:43,131 --> 05:35:45,758
Sometime today,
Old Biff will show up

4855
05:35:45,842 --> 05:35:47,260
to give Young Biff
the almanac.

4856
05:35:47,344 --> 05:35:49,428
Above all you, must not
interfere with that event.

4857
05:35:49,513 --> 05:35:52,473
We must let Old Biff believe he's
succeeded, so that he'll leave 1955

4858
05:35:52,557 --> 05:35:53,808
and bring the DeLorean
back to the future.

4859
05:35:53,892 --> 05:35:54,934
Right.

4860
05:35:55,018 --> 05:35:58,145
Once Old Biff is gone, grab the
almanac any way that you can.

4861
05:35:58,230 --> 05:36:00,398
Remember, both of our
futures depend on this.

4862
05:36:00,482 --> 05:36:02,441
You don't have to
remind me of that, Doc.

4863
05:36:02,526 --> 05:36:07,113
Here's some binoculars and a
walkie-talkie so we can keep in contact.

4864
05:36:07,197 --> 05:36:10,241
I'll stay here and try to repair
the short in the time circuit.

4865
05:36:10,325 --> 05:36:13,119
That way, we don't risk anyone
else stealing the time machine,

4866
05:36:13,203 --> 05:36:17,498
and I won't risk accidentally
running into my other self.

4867
05:36:17,582 --> 05:36:18,582
Other self?

4868
05:36:18,667 --> 05:36:20,835
Yes. There are now
two of me here,

4869
05:36:20,919 --> 05:36:22,795
and there are
two of you here.

4870
05:36:22,879 --> 05:36:26,966
The other me is the Dr.
Emmett Brown from 1955,

4871
05:36:27,050 --> 05:36:32,013
the younger me that helps the
other you get back to 1985.

4872
05:36:32,764 --> 05:36:34,390
Remember the lightning bolt
at the clock tower?

4873
05:36:34,474 --> 05:36:36,475
Yeah. That event doesn't
happen until tonight,

4874
05:36:36,560 --> 05:36:39,145
so you must be very careful
not to run into your other self.

4875
05:36:39,229 --> 05:36:40,396
Let me give you
some money.

4876
05:36:44,234 --> 05:36:47,486
I have to be prepared for
all monetary possibilities.

4877
05:36:47,571 --> 05:36:48,821
Get yourself
some '50s clothes.

4878
05:36:48,905 --> 05:36:50,531
Check, Doc.

4879
05:36:51,742 --> 05:36:53,576
Something inconspicuous.

4880
05:36:54,828 --> 05:36:57,496
Doc. Come in, Doc.
This is Marty. Over.

4881
05:36:57,581 --> 05:36:59,790
Roger, Marty. This is Doc.
Are you there?

4882
05:36:59,875 --> 05:37:03,377
Yeah, Doc.
I'm at the address.

4883
05:37:03,462 --> 05:37:04,670
It's the only Tannen
in the book,

4884
05:37:04,755 --> 05:37:06,756
but I don't think
this is Biff's house.

4885
05:37:06,840 --> 05:37:08,716
It looks like some
old lady lives here.

4886
05:37:08,800 --> 05:37:10,468
Biff!
Yeah.

4887
05:37:10,969 --> 05:37:12,928
Where are you
going, Biff?

4888
05:37:13,013 --> 05:37:15,097
I'm going to get
my car, Grandma.

4889
05:37:15,182 --> 05:37:16,307
When are you
coming back?

4890
05:37:16,391 --> 05:37:18,851
My feet hurt, and I want
you to rub my toes some more.

4891
05:37:18,935 --> 05:37:20,936
Shut up,
you old bag.

4892
05:37:21,021 --> 05:37:23,356
Give us
our ball back.

4893
05:37:23,440 --> 05:37:25,232
What ball?
That ball!

4894
05:37:25,317 --> 05:37:27,360
What ball are
you talking about?

4895
05:37:27,444 --> 05:37:29,111
Give us our ball!

4896
05:37:29,196 --> 05:37:30,946
What ball?
Biff!

4897
05:37:31,156 --> 05:37:32,865
Is this your ball?
Yeah!

4898
05:37:32,949 --> 05:37:34,408
Is it your ball?
You want it back?

4899
05:37:34,493 --> 05:37:35,951
Yeah.

4900
05:37:37,621 --> 05:37:39,038
Go get it.

4901
05:37:42,667 --> 05:37:46,962
Doc, it is Biff's house.
I'm on him. Over.

4902
05:37:55,138 --> 05:37:56,263
Hey.

4903
05:37:58,934 --> 05:38:00,059
Looking good, Terry.

4904
05:38:00,143 --> 05:38:01,769
Hey, Biff, she's all
fixed up just like new,

4905
05:38:01,853 --> 05:38:03,437
but I couldn't
get her started.

4906
05:38:03,522 --> 05:38:05,356
You got some kind of
kill switch on this thing?

4907
05:38:05,440 --> 05:38:07,066
No, you just gotta
have the right touch.

4908
05:38:07,150 --> 05:38:08,943
Nobody can start
this car but me.

4909
05:38:09,027 --> 05:38:10,945
Yeah, the bill
comes to $302.57.

4910
05:38:11,029 --> 05:38:12,196
300 bucks?

4911
05:38:12,280 --> 05:38:13,989
300 bucks for
a couple of dents?

4912
05:38:14,074 --> 05:38:15,324
No, hey,
that's bullshit, Terry.

4913
05:38:15,409 --> 05:38:16,617
No, Biff,
it was horse shit.

4914
05:38:16,701 --> 05:38:17,827
The whole car
was full of it.

4915
05:38:17,911 --> 05:38:19,954
We had to pay Old Man Jones
80 bucks to haul it away.

4916
05:38:20,038 --> 05:38:21,372
Old Man Jones
probably resold it, too.

4917
05:38:21,456 --> 05:38:22,581
Now I ought to get
something for that.

4918
05:38:22,666 --> 05:38:23,791
You want
something for it?

4919
05:38:23,875 --> 05:38:25,668
We'll go inside. You
can call Old Man Jones.

4920
05:38:25,752 --> 05:38:26,794
If he wants to
give you a refund...

4921
05:38:26,878 --> 05:38:28,421
It's 300 bucks, Terry.

4922
05:38:28,505 --> 05:38:32,091
If I catch the guy that caused
this, I'll break his neck.

4923
05:38:32,509 --> 05:38:35,386
The manure.
I remember that.

4924
05:38:41,935 --> 05:38:43,936
Four cans of Valvoline
is fair, Biff.

4925
05:38:44,020 --> 05:38:45,604
Four cans
for a $300 job?

4926
05:38:45,689 --> 05:38:47,148
I couldn't even
have lunch in the shop.

4927
05:38:47,190 --> 05:38:48,399
Makes me nauseous. I
should get a case of oil

4928
05:38:48,525 --> 05:38:50,359
out of you for a 300 buck
job. You've been inside.

4929
05:38:50,444 --> 05:38:52,111
It smells worse than the
bathroom at a gas station.

4930
05:38:52,195 --> 05:38:53,487
You robbed me again,
Terry. Yeah, yeah.

4931
05:38:53,572 --> 05:38:55,322
The smell's never
gonna go away, Biff.

4932
05:38:55,407 --> 05:38:56,407
Never gonna go away.

4933
05:38:56,533 --> 05:38:58,075
Last time I do you a favor.
Last time. Thanks a lot.

4934
05:39:00,537 --> 05:39:01,537
Let me see.

4935
05:39:05,709 --> 05:39:07,460
It's perfect,
Lorraine.

4936
05:39:07,544 --> 05:39:08,669
Oh, look at it!

4937
05:39:08,753 --> 05:39:10,379
You're going to
look so good!

4938
05:39:15,260 --> 05:39:16,302
You're going
to look...

4939
05:39:16,386 --> 05:39:17,970
Well, lookey
what we have here.

4940
05:39:18,054 --> 05:39:19,138
Hey, nice dress,
Lorraine.

4941
05:39:19,222 --> 05:39:21,640
Although, I think you'd look
better wearing nothing at all.

4942
05:39:21,725 --> 05:39:24,602
Biff, why don't you take a
long walk off a short pier?

4943
05:39:24,686 --> 05:39:25,728
Hey, listen, Lorraine.

4944
05:39:25,812 --> 05:39:27,146
There's that dance at
school tonight, right.

4945
05:39:27,230 --> 05:39:28,397
Now that
my car's all fixed,

4946
05:39:28,482 --> 05:39:29,690
I figure
I'd cut you a break

4947
05:39:29,774 --> 05:39:31,025
and give you
the honor of going

4948
05:39:31,109 --> 05:39:32,526
with the best-looking
guy in school.

4949
05:39:32,611 --> 05:39:33,652
Yeah, well, I'm busy.

4950
05:39:33,737 --> 05:39:35,321
Yeah, doing what?
Washing my hair.

4951
05:39:35,405 --> 05:39:38,073
That's about as funny as a
screen door on a battleship.

4952
05:39:38,158 --> 05:39:40,201
Screen door on
a submarine, you dork.

4953
05:39:40,285 --> 05:39:42,912
Look, Biff, somebody already
asked me to the dance.

4954
05:39:43,497 --> 05:39:45,831
Who? That bug
George McFly?

4955
05:39:46,291 --> 05:39:48,959
I'm going with
Calvin Klein, okay?

4956
05:39:49,044 --> 05:39:50,753
Calvin Klein?
No, it's not okay.

4957
05:39:51,379 --> 05:39:53,005
You're going
with me, understand?

4958
05:39:53,089 --> 05:39:54,381
Get your cooties
off me!

4959
05:39:54,466 --> 05:39:56,634
When are you gonna get it through
your thick skull, Lorraine?

4960
05:39:56,718 --> 05:39:58,010
You're my girl.

4961
05:39:58,094 --> 05:39:59,887
Biff Tannen,
I wouldn't be your girl

4962
05:39:59,971 --> 05:40:02,640
even if you had
a million dollars!

4963
05:40:06,269 --> 05:40:08,687
Yes, you will! It's
you and me, Lorraine.

4964
05:40:09,856 --> 05:40:11,065
Watch it!

4965
05:40:11,149 --> 05:40:12,942
It's meant to be.

4966
05:40:13,026 --> 05:40:15,194
I'm going to marry
you someday, Lorraine.

4967
05:40:15,278 --> 05:40:17,196
Someday you'll
be my wife!

4968
05:40:20,450 --> 05:40:22,952
You always did
have a way with women.

4969
05:40:23,036 --> 05:40:25,037
Get the hell out
of my car, old man.

4970
05:40:25,121 --> 05:40:26,580
You want to marry
that girl, Biff?

4971
05:40:26,665 --> 05:40:28,040
I can help
make it happen.

4972
05:40:28,124 --> 05:40:30,209
Oh, yeah? Who are you,
Miss Lonely-Hearts?

4973
05:40:30,293 --> 05:40:33,045
Just get in the car,
butthead.

4974
05:40:33,171 --> 05:40:35,589
Who are you calling
butthead, butthead?

4975
05:40:36,299 --> 05:40:37,424
How do you know
how to do that?

4976
05:40:37,509 --> 05:40:39,969
Nobody can start
this car but me.

4977
05:40:40,053 --> 05:40:43,597
Just get in the car, Tannen.
Today's your lucky day.

4978
05:40:46,184 --> 05:40:49,812
Hey! Hey! Hey, watch where
you're driving, old man.

4979
05:40:50,355 --> 05:40:51,897
If you dent this car,
I'll kill you.

4980
05:40:58,655 --> 05:41:00,447
This cost me
300 bucks!

4981
05:41:00,532 --> 05:41:02,575
Would you shut up
about the car?

4982
05:41:03,034 --> 05:41:04,952
Hey, and another thing. How
do you know where I live?

4983
05:41:05,036 --> 05:41:07,246
Let's just say
we're related, Biff.

4984
05:41:07,330 --> 05:41:09,873
And that being the case, I
got a little present for you.

4985
05:41:09,958 --> 05:41:12,084
Something that'll
make you rich.

4986
05:41:12,168 --> 05:41:13,168
You want to be rich,
don't you?

4987
05:41:13,253 --> 05:41:16,171
Oh, yeah. Sure. Right.
That's rich.

4988
05:41:16,256 --> 05:41:18,173
You're going
to make me rich?

4989
05:41:18,717 --> 05:41:21,927
You see this book? This
book tells the future.

4990
05:41:22,012 --> 05:41:24,013
Tells the results of
every major sports event

4991
05:41:24,097 --> 05:41:25,306
till the end
of the century.

4992
05:41:25,390 --> 05:41:29,351
Football, baseball,
horse races, boxing.

4993
05:41:30,478 --> 05:41:34,273
The information in here is worth
millions, and I'm giving it to you.

4994
05:41:34,357 --> 05:41:36,942
Well, that's very nice.
Thank you very much.

4995
05:41:37,027 --> 05:41:40,863
Now, why don't you make like
a tree and get out of here?

4996
05:41:41,865 --> 05:41:45,618
It's leave, you idiot.
Make like a tree and leave.

4997
05:41:45,702 --> 05:41:47,911
You sound like a damn fool
when you say it wrong.

4998
05:41:47,996 --> 05:41:51,874
All right, then, leave and
take your book with you.

4999
05:41:51,958 --> 05:41:55,628
Don't you get it? You could
make a fortune with this book.

5000
05:41:55,712 --> 05:41:57,171
Let me show you.

5001
05:42:01,468 --> 05:42:04,178
UCLA trails 17-16.

5002
05:42:04,262 --> 05:42:07,598
It's 4th and 11 with only
18 seconds left of this game.

5003
05:42:07,682 --> 05:42:10,809
I'd say it's
all over for UCLA.

5004
05:42:10,894 --> 05:42:14,647
Bet you a million bucks
UCLA wins it 19-17.

5005
05:42:14,731 --> 05:42:15,898
What are you,
deaf, old man?

5006
05:42:15,982 --> 05:42:18,317
He just said it was over.
You lost.

5007
05:42:18,401 --> 05:42:19,860
Oh, yeah?

5008
05:42:20,320 --> 05:42:21,654
Here comes Decker
with the kick.

5009
05:42:21,738 --> 05:42:23,238
It's up.
It looks good, folks!

5010
05:42:23,323 --> 05:42:27,618
It looks very good. Field
goal! UCLA wins 19-17.

5011
05:42:27,911 --> 05:42:31,830
Listen to that Coliseum
crowd go wild. Jim Decker...

5012
05:42:31,915 --> 05:42:33,165
All right, pops.
What's the gag?

5013
05:42:33,249 --> 05:42:35,167
How did you know what
the score was gonna be?

5014
05:42:35,251 --> 05:42:37,461
I told you.
It's in this book.

5015
05:42:37,545 --> 05:42:41,090
All you gotta do is bet on the
winner, and you'll never lose.

5016
05:42:46,680 --> 05:42:49,264
All right.
I'll take a look at it.

5017
05:42:51,685 --> 05:42:53,769
You damn fool!

5018
05:42:53,853 --> 05:42:56,772
Never, never leave
this book laying around.

5019
05:42:56,856 --> 05:42:59,775
Don't you have a safe?
No, you don't have a safe.

5020
05:43:00,944 --> 05:43:03,779
Get a safe.
Keep it locked up.

5021
05:43:03,863 --> 05:43:05,739
And until then, keep
it on you like this.

5022
05:43:05,824 --> 05:43:06,865
Hey, what are you doing?

5023
05:43:06,950 --> 05:43:08,784
And don't tell anybody about it, either.

5024
05:43:08,868 --> 05:43:10,119
And there's
one more thing.

5025
05:43:10,203 --> 05:43:14,039
One day, a kid or a
crazy, wild-eyed old man

5026
05:43:14,124 --> 05:43:15,666
who claims to
be a scientist

5027
05:43:15,750 --> 05:43:18,210
is going to come around
asking about this...

5028
05:43:20,839 --> 05:43:23,132
If that ever happens...

5029
05:43:42,819 --> 05:43:45,112
I'm trapped. Doc.

5030
05:43:45,321 --> 05:43:46,488
Doc, come in, Doc.

5031
05:43:46,573 --> 05:43:48,407
Marty, what's the report?
Biff's gone.

5032
05:43:48,950 --> 05:43:50,075
He's got the book.

5033
05:43:50,160 --> 05:43:52,202
The old man's gone, too.
I'm locked in Biff's garage.

5034
05:43:52,287 --> 05:43:53,454
You gotta fly
the DeLorean over here

5035
05:43:53,538 --> 05:43:54,663
and get me
the hell out of here.

5036
05:43:54,998 --> 05:43:56,749
The address is
1809 Mason Street.

5037
05:43:56,833 --> 05:43:58,751
I can't take the DeLorean
out in the daylight,

5038
05:43:58,835 --> 05:44:00,753
but don't worry, Marty.
Somehow I'll get over there.

5039
05:44:00,837 --> 05:44:04,173
Doc, wait a minute.
Doc. Hey, Doc. Doc.

5040
05:44:05,759 --> 05:44:07,176
Perfect.

5041
05:44:14,100 --> 05:44:16,894
I told you, Grandma.
I'm going to the dance.

5042
05:44:17,020 --> 05:44:18,979
When you coming home?
The dance.

5043
05:44:19,063 --> 05:44:21,815
I'll get home
when I get home.

5044
05:44:23,109 --> 05:44:26,028
Don't forget to turn
off the garage light.

5045
05:44:57,977 --> 05:44:59,603
Marty. Marty!

5046
05:45:00,063 --> 05:45:01,480
Marty.

5047
05:45:03,483 --> 05:45:05,943
Marty, Marty. Damn!

5048
05:45:06,736 --> 05:45:08,821
Where is that kid?

5049
05:45:15,161 --> 05:45:17,246
Doc. Doc, come in.

5050
05:45:17,914 --> 05:45:19,456
Come in, Doc.

5051
05:45:20,208 --> 05:45:21,291
Marty! Marty, come in.

5052
05:45:21,584 --> 05:45:22,793
Doc.

5053
05:45:26,631 --> 05:45:27,923
Marty.

5054
05:45:28,967 --> 05:45:30,592
Oh, my...

5055
05:45:32,262 --> 05:45:34,263
Great Scott.

5056
05:45:49,863 --> 05:45:51,238
Oh, my God.

5057
05:45:56,452 --> 05:45:57,578
Doc, Doc, come in.

5058
05:45:57,662 --> 05:45:59,288
Marty,
what happened to you?

5059
05:45:59,372 --> 05:46:00,914
I went to Biff's house,
and you weren't there.

5060
05:46:00,999 --> 05:46:02,040
You must have
just missed me.

5061
05:46:02,125 --> 05:46:03,166
I'm in the back
of Biff's car.

5062
05:46:03,251 --> 05:46:05,294
He's on his way to the
Enchantment Under the Sea dance.

5063
05:46:06,212 --> 05:46:08,213
Marty, listen, we may have
to abort this entire plan.

5064
05:46:08,298 --> 05:46:09,715
It's getting
much too dangerous.

5065
05:46:09,799 --> 05:46:11,383
Don't worry. The book
is on Biff's dashboard.

5066
05:46:11,467 --> 05:46:12,801
I'll grab it as soon
as we get to the school.

5067
05:46:12,886 --> 05:46:14,970
Marty, you must
be extremely careful

5068
05:46:15,054 --> 05:46:16,430
not to run into
your other self.

5069
05:46:16,514 --> 05:46:18,140
My other self?
Yes.

5070
05:46:18,850 --> 05:46:22,978
Remember, your mother is at that
exact same dance with you. Yeah.

5071
05:46:23,062 --> 05:46:25,230
Right. This could
get heavy, Doc.

5072
05:46:25,315 --> 05:46:26,481
Heavy, heavy.

5073
05:46:26,566 --> 05:46:29,192
Marty, whatever happens, you must
not let your other self see you!

5074
05:46:29,277 --> 05:46:31,486
The consequences
could be disastrous.

5075
05:46:31,571 --> 05:46:32,863
Excuse me, sir.

5076
05:46:34,032 --> 05:46:35,574
Yes, you with the hat.

5077
05:46:35,658 --> 05:46:36,742
Who, me?

5078
05:46:36,826 --> 05:46:37,868
Yes.

5079
05:46:38,244 --> 05:46:41,997
Be a pal and hand me a five-eighths
inch wrench out of that toolbox.

5080
05:46:43,082 --> 05:46:44,666
Five-eighths?

5081
05:46:46,336 --> 05:46:48,754
Don't you mean
three-quarters?

5082
05:46:49,505 --> 05:46:51,590
Why, you're right.

5083
05:46:52,383 --> 05:46:57,012
I presume you're conducting
some sort of weather experiment.

5084
05:46:59,015 --> 05:47:02,100
That's right.
How did you know that?

5085
05:47:02,185 --> 05:47:06,146
I happen to have had a little
experience in this area.

5086
05:47:06,230 --> 05:47:08,899
Yes, well, I'm hoping to
see some lightning tonight.

5087
05:47:08,983 --> 05:47:12,027
Although, the weatherman says
there's not gonna be any rain.

5088
05:47:12,111 --> 05:47:13,403
There's going to be
plenty of rain, all right.

5089
05:47:13,488 --> 05:47:15,697
Wind, thunder,
lightning.

5090
05:47:15,782 --> 05:47:17,491
It's gonna be one
hell of a storm.

5091
05:47:17,575 --> 05:47:20,369
Well, thanks.
Nice talking to you.

5092
05:47:20,453 --> 05:47:24,289
Maybe we'll bump into each other
some time again in the future.


5093
05:47:25,291 --> 05:47:26,917
Or in the past.

5094
05:48:08,001 --> 05:48:09,751
Doc, Doc! Come in!

5095
05:49:22,992 --> 05:49:25,786
Where's that punk
Calvin Klein, anyway?

5096
05:49:25,870 --> 05:49:26,912
How am I
supposed to know, Biff?

5097
05:49:26,996 --> 05:49:28,080
I ain't his secretary.

5098
05:49:28,164 --> 05:49:31,083
Well, go find him. He caused
300 bucks damage to my car,

5099
05:49:31,167 --> 05:49:33,710
and I owe him a knuckle
sandwich. Get going!

5100
05:49:33,795 --> 05:49:35,087
Drink up, Biff.
Yeah, thanks.

5101
05:49:35,171 --> 05:49:36,171
Ain't you coming?

5102
05:49:36,255 --> 05:49:37,464
I'm reading.

5103
05:50:30,059 --> 05:50:32,269
Well, well, well,
Mr. Tannen.

5104
05:50:33,396 --> 05:50:35,147
How nice
to see you here.

5105
05:50:35,231 --> 05:50:38,316
Why, Mr. Strickland,
it's nice to see you, sir.

5106
05:50:38,401 --> 05:50:39,776
Is that liquor
I smell, Tannen?

5107
05:50:40,319 --> 05:50:41,820
I wouldn't know.

5108
05:50:41,904 --> 05:50:43,155
I don't know what
liquor smells like,

5109
05:50:43,239 --> 05:50:44,447
'cause I'm too
young to drink it.

5110
05:50:44,532 --> 05:50:45,866
I see.

5111
05:50:46,325 --> 05:50:48,201
And what have we here?

5112
05:50:51,747 --> 05:50:55,250
Sports statistics, interesting
subject. Homework, Tannen?

5113
05:50:55,334 --> 05:50:58,170
No, it ain't homework,
'cause I ain't at home.

5114
05:51:00,256 --> 05:51:01,381
You've got a real
attitude problem.

5115
05:51:01,465 --> 05:51:03,049
You know that, Tannen?
Just watch it.

5116
05:51:03,134 --> 05:51:04,176
Because one day,
I'll have you

5117
05:51:04,260 --> 05:51:06,720
right where I want you
in detention.

5118
05:51:06,804 --> 05:51:07,929
Slacker!

5119
05:51:20,776 --> 05:51:22,736
Jesus,
you smoke, too?

5120
05:51:22,820 --> 05:51:25,572
Marty, you're beginning to
sound just like my mother.

5121
05:51:25,656 --> 05:51:27,073
Yeah, right.

5122
05:51:27,158 --> 05:51:30,452
When I have kids, I'm going to
let them do anything they want.

5123
05:51:30,536 --> 05:51:32,037
Anything at all.

5124
05:51:32,121 --> 05:51:33,705
Yeah, I'd like to
have that in writing.

5125
05:51:33,789 --> 05:51:35,040
Yeah, me, too.

5126
05:51:35,124 --> 05:51:37,876
Marty,
why are you so nervous?

5127
05:53:43,085 --> 05:53:44,252
Yes!

5128
05:53:48,049 --> 05:53:49,132
No!

5129
05:53:51,927 --> 05:53:59,351
"Oh Là Là?"

5130
05:54:05,107 --> 05:54:06,441
Doc! Doc!

5131
05:54:06,525 --> 05:54:07,692
Hey, you.

5132
05:54:07,777 --> 05:54:09,361
Doc, come in!

5133
05:54:09,445 --> 05:54:10,695
Marty, what's up?

5134
05:54:10,780 --> 05:54:13,281
Doc! I'm in trouble.
I blew it.

5135
05:54:13,366 --> 05:54:14,491
Where's the book?

5136
05:54:14,575 --> 05:54:15,784
Biff must still
have it with him.

5137
05:54:15,951 --> 05:54:17,285
All I got is
the damn cover.

5138
05:54:17,370 --> 05:54:18,578
And where's Biff?

5139
05:54:18,662 --> 05:54:20,705
You're asking for it.
I don't know.

5140
05:54:20,790 --> 05:54:22,082
Don't you have any
idea where he is?

5141
05:54:22,166 --> 05:54:24,501
No! I mean, he could
be anywhere by now.

5142
05:54:24,585 --> 05:54:26,127
Marty, the entire
future depends on you

5143
05:54:26,212 --> 05:54:28,213
finding Biff and
getting that book back!

5144
05:54:28,297 --> 05:54:29,631
I know.
I just don't know where...

5145
05:54:29,715 --> 05:54:31,216
Stop it!

5146
05:54:31,300 --> 05:54:34,803
Stop it, Biff. You'll
break his arm. Stop it!

5147
05:54:38,891 --> 05:54:40,308
Of course!

5148
05:54:40,976 --> 05:54:43,019
I gotta go.
I got one chance!

5149
05:54:43,104 --> 05:54:45,146
My old man is
about to deck Biff!

5150
05:54:52,571 --> 05:54:53,780
Yes!

5151
05:55:07,086 --> 05:55:08,670
Talk about déjà vu.

5152
05:55:08,921 --> 05:55:10,547
Are you okay?

5153
05:55:30,359 --> 05:55:32,277
Okay, everybody,
let's back up now.

5154
05:55:32,361 --> 05:55:34,487
Let's back up. Let's
everybody just back up

5155
05:55:34,572 --> 05:55:35,947
and give him a little bit of room, okay.

5156
05:55:36,031 --> 05:55:37,031
A little bit of air.

5157
05:55:37,116 --> 05:55:40,034
It's okay.
I know CPR. I know CPR.

5158
05:55:40,119 --> 05:55:41,244
Hey.

5159
05:55:41,328 --> 05:55:42,704
What's CPR?

5160
05:55:42,788 --> 05:55:43,872
You!

5161
05:55:47,710 --> 05:55:48,710
He's fine.

5162
05:55:48,794 --> 05:55:50,795
Hey, did you
just take his wallet?

5163
05:55:50,880 --> 05:55:52,589
He just took
that guy's wallet.

5164
05:55:53,048 --> 05:55:55,467
Doc, success.
I got it.

5165
05:55:55,551 --> 05:55:57,469
Thank goodness.

5166
05:55:58,471 --> 05:56:00,138
Great, Marty.

5167
05:56:00,222 --> 05:56:02,140
As soon as I reload
the fusion generator,

5168
05:56:02,224 --> 05:56:04,601
I'll meet you on the roof
of the high school gym.

5169
05:56:04,685 --> 05:56:06,144
On the roof. 10-4.

5170
05:56:06,228 --> 05:56:07,812
Hey, it's him!

5171
05:56:07,897 --> 05:56:09,189
Hey, he's in disguise.

5172
05:56:09,273 --> 05:56:11,149
Guys, what's that?

5173
05:56:12,985 --> 05:56:14,694
Come on!
Let's get him!

5174
05:56:21,952 --> 05:56:23,077
Damn!

5175
05:56:32,546 --> 05:56:34,172
Earth angel

5176
05:56:34,381 --> 05:56:37,133
Please be mine

5177
05:56:37,801 --> 05:56:39,928
My darling dear

5178
05:56:40,095 --> 05:56:43,306
Love you for all time

5179
05:56:43,933 --> 05:56:46,684
I'm just a fool

5180
05:56:48,521 --> 05:56:51,439
A fool in love

5181
05:56:52,942 --> 05:56:56,194
with you

5182
05:57:02,284 --> 05:57:04,327
All right!
Let's do another one.

5183
05:57:04,620 --> 05:57:06,913
Where did he go?
He just came in here!

5184
05:57:08,374 --> 05:57:09,541
Something
that really cooks.

5185
05:57:10,709 --> 05:57:12,168
Look! How did he
get up on stage?

5186
05:57:12,253 --> 05:57:14,546
I don't know, but when he gets
down, we're gonna nail him.

5187
05:57:14,630 --> 05:57:17,048
How the hell did he
change his clothes so fast?

5188
05:57:17,132 --> 05:57:19,592
All right, it's an
oldie where I come from.

5189
05:57:19,677 --> 05:57:21,844
All right, guys, listen,
this is a blues riff in B.

5190
05:57:21,929 --> 05:57:25,223
Watch me for the changes,
and try and keep up, okay?

5191
05:57:30,688 --> 05:57:31,980
Doc. Doc, come in!

5192
05:57:32,064 --> 05:57:33,273
Marty, come in.

5193
05:57:33,357 --> 05:57:37,902
Listen, Biff's guys chased me into
the gym, and they're going to jump me.

5194
05:57:37,987 --> 05:57:39,404
Then get out of there!

5195
05:57:39,488 --> 05:57:41,406
No, Doc, not me.
The other me.

5196
05:57:41,490 --> 05:57:43,825
The one that's up on stage
playing Johnny B. Goode.

5197
05:57:43,909 --> 05:57:45,451
Great Scott!
Your other self will miss

5198
05:57:45,536 --> 05:57:46,703
the lightning bolt
at the clock tower,

5199
05:57:46,787 --> 05:57:48,788
you won't get back to the future,
and we'll have a major paradox!

5200
05:57:48,872 --> 05:57:50,832
Wait, wait, wait.
A paradox?

5201
05:57:50,916 --> 05:57:53,251
You mean one of those things
that can destroy the universe?

5202
05:57:53,335 --> 05:57:55,628
Precisely. Marty, you have to
stop those guys at all costs,

5203
05:57:55,713 --> 05:57:58,673
but without being seen by your
other self or your parents.

5204
05:57:58,757 --> 05:58:00,008
10-4.

5205
05:58:01,343 --> 05:58:02,677
What the hell?

5206
05:58:06,348 --> 05:58:07,849
Where is he?
Who?

5207
05:58:07,933 --> 05:58:09,475
Calvin Klein.
Who?

5208
05:58:09,560 --> 05:58:10,768
The guy with the hat,
where is he?

5209
05:58:10,853 --> 05:58:12,979
Oh. He went that way.

5210
05:58:13,063 --> 05:58:16,816
I think he took your wallet.
I think he took his wallet.

5211
05:58:17,568 --> 05:58:19,485
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

5212
05:58:21,238 --> 05:58:22,864
Johnny B. Goode

5213
05:58:41,342 --> 05:58:42,675
Go, go

5214
05:58:43,093 --> 05:58:45,053
Go, Johnny, go, go

5215
05:58:45,888 --> 05:58:47,889
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

5216
05:58:48,766 --> 05:58:50,850
Go, Johnny, go, go

5217
05:58:51,685 --> 05:58:53,728
Go, Johnny, go, go, go

5218
05:58:55,230 --> 05:58:56,689
Johnny B. Goode

5219
06:00:13,183 --> 06:00:15,893
I guess you guys aren't
ready for that yet.

5220
06:00:16,979 --> 06:00:19,522
But your kids are
going to love it.

5221
06:00:27,990 --> 06:00:30,324
Hey, Doc, success.
Everything's cool.

5222
06:00:30,409 --> 06:00:33,578
Great. I'll be landing at the
school roof in about one minute.

5223
06:00:33,662 --> 06:00:35,329
I'll be there.

5224
06:00:42,838 --> 06:00:44,088
Lorraine.

5225
06:00:44,173 --> 06:00:47,550
Marty, that was
very interesting music.

5226
06:00:51,847 --> 06:00:52,889
I hope you don't mind,

5227
06:00:52,973 --> 06:00:54,974
but George asked if
he could take me home.

5228
06:00:55,350 --> 06:00:58,352
Great. Lorraine, I had
a feeling about you two.

5229
06:00:58,437 --> 06:01:00,271
I have a feeling, too.

5230
06:01:00,856 --> 06:01:02,523
Hey, butthead!

5231
06:01:03,442 --> 06:01:06,360
You think that stupid
disguise would get by me?

5232
06:01:07,196 --> 06:01:11,199
Let's have it out.
You and me, right now.

5233
06:01:12,242 --> 06:01:13,701
No, thanks.

5234
06:01:15,537 --> 06:01:17,622
What's the matter?

5235
06:01:17,706 --> 06:01:19,707
Where are you going?

5236
06:01:19,792 --> 06:01:21,501
Are you chicken?

5237
06:01:22,753 --> 06:01:25,963
That's it, isn't it?
Nothing but a little chicken.

5238
06:01:40,604 --> 06:01:44,273
Nobody
calls me chicken.

5239
06:01:52,574 --> 06:01:53,991
What the hell?

5240
06:01:56,119 --> 06:01:57,954
You steal my stuff?

5241
06:01:59,748 --> 06:02:01,833
And this one's
for my car!

5242
06:02:27,484 --> 06:02:28,609
Doc!

5243
06:02:28,819 --> 06:02:30,862
Doc! I blew it.

5244
06:02:31,530 --> 06:02:32,780
Biff nailed me.
He took the book.

5245
06:02:32,865 --> 06:02:35,032
He drove away
with it in his car.

5246
06:02:35,117 --> 06:02:37,243
It's my fault, Doc. I should
have got out of there sooner.

5247
06:02:37,327 --> 06:02:39,203
No time for that now.
Which way did he go?

5248
06:02:39,288 --> 06:02:40,371
East towards
the River Road Tunnel.

5249
06:02:40,455 --> 06:02:41,455
Get in!

5250
06:02:52,801 --> 06:02:54,385
Yes!

5251
06:02:54,469 --> 06:02:55,970
There he is, Doc!

5252
06:02:56,346 --> 06:02:58,306
Let's land on him.
We'll cripple his car.

5253
06:02:58,390 --> 06:03:00,308
Marty, he's in a '46 Ford.
We're a DeLorean.

5254
06:03:00,392 --> 06:03:02,935
He'd rip through us
like we were tin foil.

5255
06:03:03,020 --> 06:03:05,021
So what do we do?
I have a plan.

5256
06:03:05,105 --> 06:03:07,189
Repeating tonight's
earlier weather bulletin,

5257
06:03:07,274 --> 06:03:09,817
a severe thunderstorm is
heading for Hill Valley.

5258
06:03:32,257 --> 06:03:34,342
Serving Hill Valley
and all of Hill County,

5259
06:03:34,426 --> 06:03:37,511
you're tuned to KKHV,
the voice of Hill Valley.

5260
06:03:45,687 --> 06:03:47,355
Turning to
community calendar,

5261
06:03:47,439 --> 06:03:49,231
the Hill Valley
Women's Club bake sale

5262
06:03:49,316 --> 06:03:50,608
will be held
tomorrow afternoon

5263
06:03:50,692 --> 06:03:54,445
from 2:00 to 5:00 at the
community center on Forest Road.

5264
06:03:54,529 --> 06:03:55,780
For you sports fans
out there,

5265
06:03:55,864 --> 06:03:58,366
there was a lot of action
today in college football.

5266
06:03:58,450 --> 06:04:00,534
Here's what happened
to the top 10.

5267
06:04:00,619 --> 06:04:04,288
UCLA narrowly
defeated Washington 19-17.

5268
06:04:04,373 --> 06:04:07,708
Michigan State
crushed Minnesota 42-14.

5269
06:04:07,793 --> 06:04:10,503
Ohio State
beat Iowa 20-10.

5270
06:04:10,587 --> 06:04:12,046
Michigan
blanked Indiana 30-0.

5271
06:04:12,130 --> 06:04:13,214
Shit.

5272
06:04:13,298 --> 06:04:15,007
It was Notre Dame over
North Carolina, 27-7.

5273
06:04:15,092 --> 06:04:16,425
Son of a bitch.

5274
06:04:16,510 --> 06:04:19,428
Oklahoma ripped
Iowa State 52-0.

5275
06:04:20,389 --> 06:04:23,182
West Virginia lost
to Pittsburgh 26-7.

5276
06:04:23,558 --> 06:04:26,519
Texas A&M over Rice 20-10.

5277
06:04:26,603 --> 06:04:29,188
Maryland
defeated Clemson 25-12,

5278
06:04:29,272 --> 06:04:33,317
and it was Texas
Christian over Texas 47-20.

5279
06:04:33,402 --> 06:04:36,988
Repeating tonight's earlier
weather bulletin, a severe...

5280
06:04:37,072 --> 06:04:39,573
You again?
Give me that book.

5281
06:04:42,035 --> 06:04:43,327
Let it go!

5282
06:04:46,123 --> 06:04:47,331
Whoa!

5283
06:04:50,752 --> 06:04:52,753
Let go of the car!

5284
06:05:26,288 --> 06:05:27,955
That'll teach him.

5285
06:06:28,517 --> 06:06:30,017
Oh!

5286
06:07:02,384 --> 06:07:04,051
Go, Doc!

5287
06:07:04,136 --> 06:07:05,678
Hold on, Marty!

5288
06:07:10,684 --> 06:07:12,059
Shit!

5289
06:07:18,900 --> 06:07:19,942
Yes!

5290
06:07:30,287 --> 06:07:33,247
Manure!
I hate manure!

5291
06:07:57,606 --> 06:08:00,232
Doc, is everything
all right? Over.

5292
06:08:00,317 --> 06:08:03,027
10-4, Marty, but it's pretty
miserable flying weather.

5293
06:08:03,111 --> 06:08:04,695
Much too turbulent to make a
landing from this direction.

5294
06:08:04,779 --> 06:08:07,198
I'll have to circle around and
make a long approach from the south.

5295
06:08:07,282 --> 06:08:09,783
Have you got the book?

5296
06:08:09,868 --> 06:08:12,453
In my hand, Doc!
I got it in my hand!

5297
06:08:12,537 --> 06:08:14,288
Burn it!

5298
06:08:14,372 --> 06:08:15,706
Check!

5299
06:09:11,179 --> 06:09:14,139
Doc! Doc!
That newspaper changed.

5300
06:09:14,224 --> 06:09:15,849
Doc, my father's alive!

5301
06:09:15,934 --> 06:09:18,811
That means everything's
back to normal, right?

5302
06:09:22,524 --> 06:09:24,191
Mission accomplished.

5303
06:09:24,818 --> 06:09:27,403
That means Jennifer's okay
and Einie's okay, right?

5304
06:09:27,487 --> 06:09:30,614
That's right, Marty.
It's the ripple effect.

5305
06:09:30,699 --> 06:09:32,741
The future is back,
so let's go home.

5306
06:09:32,826 --> 06:09:35,619
Right. Let's get our
asses back to the...

5307
06:09:41,918 --> 06:09:43,711
Doc, Doc,
are you okay?

5308
06:09:44,045 --> 06:09:47,256
That was a close one, Marty.
I almost bought the farm.

5309
06:09:50,593 --> 06:09:54,388
Well, be careful. You don't
want to get struck by lightning.

5310
06:10:08,611 --> 06:10:09,737
Doc.

5311
06:10:18,747 --> 06:10:19,788
Doc?

5312
06:10:20,957 --> 06:10:22,666
Doc, come in, Doc.

5313
06:10:24,336 --> 06:10:26,211
Doc, do you read me?

5314
06:10:27,130 --> 06:10:30,549
Do you read me, Doc?
Come in. Doc.

5315
06:10:43,480 --> 06:10:44,688
Oh, no.

5316
06:10:53,281 --> 06:10:54,782
He's gone.

5317
06:10:56,785 --> 06:10:58,452
The doc's gone.

5318
06:11:21,309 --> 06:11:22,643
Mr. McFly!

5319
06:11:23,436 --> 06:11:24,478
Huh?

5320
06:11:27,315 --> 06:11:29,817
Is your name
Marty McFly?

5321
06:11:34,823 --> 06:11:36,323
Yeah.

5322
06:11:38,159 --> 06:11:40,411
I've got something for you.

5323
06:11:42,705 --> 06:11:44,331
A letter.

5324
06:11:45,417 --> 06:11:47,167
A letter for me?

5325
06:11:48,253 --> 06:11:49,878
That's impossible.

5326
06:11:51,506 --> 06:11:52,714
Who the hell are you?

5327
06:11:52,799 --> 06:11:53,924
Western Union.

5328
06:11:54,509 --> 06:11:56,927
Actually, a bunch of us at
the office were kind of hoping

5329
06:11:57,011 --> 06:11:59,304
maybe you could shed
some light on the subject.

5330
06:11:59,389 --> 06:12:03,851
See, we've had that envelope in our
possession for the past 70 years.

5331
06:12:06,855 --> 06:12:09,773
It was given to us with
the explicit instructions

5332
06:12:09,858 --> 06:12:14,027
that it be delivered to a
young man with your description

5333
06:12:14,112 --> 06:12:17,906
answering to the name of
Marty at this exact location

5334
06:12:18,741 --> 06:12:22,661
at this exact minute,
November 12, 1955.

5335
06:12:23,204 --> 06:12:24,538
We have a little bet
going as to whether

5336
06:12:24,622 --> 06:12:26,457
this Marty would
actually be here.

5337
06:12:26,541 --> 06:12:28,292
Looks like I lost.

5338
06:12:29,210 --> 06:12:30,669
Did you say 70 years?

5339
06:12:30,753 --> 06:12:33,505
Yeah, 70 years, 2 months,
12 days to be exact.

5340
06:12:33,590 --> 06:12:35,466
Here sign on line 6,
please.

5341
06:12:35,550 --> 06:12:36,925
Here you are.

5342
06:12:47,270 --> 06:12:49,605
It's from the doc!

5343
06:12:53,443 --> 06:12:56,320
"Dear Marty, if my
calculations are correct,

5344
06:12:56,404 --> 06:12:57,988
"you will receive this
letter immediately after

5345
06:12:58,072 --> 06:13:00,991
"you saw the DeLorean
struck by lightning.

5346
06:13:01,075 --> 06:13:04,036
"First, let me assure you
that I'm alive and well.

5347
06:13:04,120 --> 06:13:07,581
"I've been living happily these
past eight months in the year 1885.

5348
06:13:07,665 --> 06:13:10,584
"The lightning bolt... "
1885!

5349
06:13:11,252 --> 06:13:12,753
"September, 1885."

5350
06:13:13,588 --> 06:13:17,007
Wait, wait, kid! Wait a
minute. What's this all about?

5351
06:13:17,091 --> 06:13:19,927
He's alive!
The doc's alive!

5352
06:13:20,678 --> 06:13:22,846
He's in the Old West,
but he's alive.

5353
06:13:22,931 --> 06:13:24,431
Yeah, but, kid,
you all right?

5354
06:13:24,933 --> 06:13:26,141
Do you need any help?

5355
06:13:26,768 --> 06:13:28,977
There's only one man
who can help me.

5356
06:14:44,387 --> 06:14:46,096
Doc! Doc! Doc!

5357
06:14:46,889 --> 06:14:48,724
Doc! Doc!
What?

5358
06:14:50,518 --> 06:14:52,811
Okay, relax, Doc. It's
me. It's me! It's Marty.

5359
06:14:52,895 --> 06:14:55,439
No, it can't be. I just
sent you back to the future.

5360
06:14:55,523 --> 06:14:56,648
Yeah. No, I know.
You did send me

5361
06:14:56,733 --> 06:14:58,692
back to the future,
but I'm back.

5362
06:14:58,776 --> 06:15:00,902
I'm back
from the future.

5363
06:15:04,032 --> 06:15:05,699
Great Scott!

5364
06:15:07,785 --> 06:15:10,871
Doc! Doc. Doc.

5365
06:15:13,041 --> 06:15:14,416
Fantastic.

5366
06:15:31,976 --> 06:15:33,393
Hey, McFly.

5367
06:15:41,402 --> 06:15:43,403
Just try it, Tannen!

5368
06:15:43,821 --> 06:15:46,740
Come on, runt! You can
dance better than that!
